Chlorinations of aromatic substrates by 7¬∑Cl‚àí both on the ring as well in benzylic positions (if available) were possible with electron rich substrates (, entries 7,8,10,11) while xylene (entry 9) was inert even at 60 ¬∞C. This is consistent with an electrophilic delivery of Cl+ by B. In line with this is the observed regioselectivity in the chlorination of 4-methylanisole in its 2- and 4-position (entry 11) consistent with the reported reactivity of this substrate in electrophilic chlorinations., Equally, we propose that benzylic chlorinations in entries 6, 7, and 8 are a consequence of initial Cl+-delivery to the aromatic ring by B similar to the benzylic chlorination mechanism proposed Baciocchi and Illuminati for highly methylated arenes. For example, in the reaction of 7¬∑Cl‚àí with durene the initially formed intermediate B would electrophilically deliver Cl‚àí to the Œ±- and the Œ≤-position of the œÄ-system to form F and G (). While F then produces the ring chlorination product, G undergoes a Baciocchi-Illuminati sequence including deprotonation and 1,5-Cl-shift from H to form the benzylic chlorination product. The observed biases for aromatic over benzylic chlorination products in entry 7 (aromatic/benzylic = 3.5:1) and entry 8 (aromatic/benzylic = 12:1) compare reasonably well with those found in previously reported electrophilic chlorinations of durene (aromatic/benzylic = 5.9:1) and mesitylene with quantitative aromatic substitution.",/pmc/articles/PMC4116810/figure/F16/,PMC4116810,nihms266447f16.jpg

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) is the major control complex for autophagy. A diverse range of signals, such as growth factors and amino acids, regulates mTORC1 by inhibiting the Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1/2), thereby alleviating the inhibitory effect of TSC1/2 on the Ras homolog enriched in the brain (Rheb), which subsequently activates mTORC1. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) also inhibits mTORC1 via inhibition of the Regulatory associated protein of mTOR (Raptor). mTORC1 is tethered to the lysosomal surface via the Ras-related GTPases (Rags), which activity is regulated by the amino acid sensing of the the vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphatase ATPase (v-ATPase) and the Proton-assisted amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1). Conversion of GTP-GDP is performed by the GTPase-activating proteins/ Guanine-exchange factor (GAP/GEF) activity of Folliculin (FLCN) and Ragulator. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 suppresses autophagy by mediating phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK1) and the Transcription factor EB/E3 (TFEB/TFE3). Under starvation, ULK1 activation promotes autophagy initiation and autophagosome maturation, and TFEB/TFE3 promote transcription of genes regulating autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis.",/pmc/articles/PMC5789368/figure/cancers-10-00018-f001/,PMC5789368,cancers-10-00018-g001.jpg

Although CYP epoxygenases can synthesize all four EET regioisomers as illustrated in the figure, 11,12- and 14,15-EET are the most abundant EETs produced by the endothelium and many other tissues. DHA or EPA epoxygenation by CYP epoxygenases has not been investigated in intact cells, so it is uncertain whether this receptor-mediated production mechanism also applies to œâ-3 PUFA epoxides.",/pmc/articles/PMC4314516/figure/F1/,PMC4314516,nihms618758f1.jpg

Activation of PI3K pathway via exogenous stimuli, endogenous signals and/or mutations promotes cancer formation, progression and resistance to therapy. The major signal modulators are PI3K in green and PTEN in red. The PI3Ks are shown as a simplified heterodimeric complex that combines the PI3K regulatory and catalytic subunits discussed in this review. As seen in the schematic representation, activated upstream cellular receptors (i.e. RTKs, GFRs, GPCRs) lead to activation of PI3Ks, which phosphorylate the membrane phospholipid substrate (i.e PIP2 into PIP3). PTEN is a phosphatase that opposes PI3K action; therefore, mutation or ablation of PTEN leads to PI3K/mTOR pathway over activation. Next, AKT is translocated to the cell membrane and is phosphorylated by PDK1 and PDK2. Once AKT is activated, it inhibits TSC1/TSC2 complex, which leads to RHEB inhibition. mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) collect the signals. mTORC1 activates downstream molecules. As a result, mTORC1 controls major processes, including cell cycle progression, growth, protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, and autophagy. mTORC2 functions are less understood, yet it is known to regulated, cell shape, cytoskeleton organization, cell survival, and cell metabolism. Therefore, PI3K/PTEN/mTOR pathway can control essential cancer cell processes, such as growth, invasion, metastases, and response to therapy.

The fruit fly D. melanogaster, the housefly M. domestica, the medfly Ceratis capitata and the honeybee Apis mellifera share a common pathway (indicated by a grey box) composed of the transformer (tra) gene and its downstream target doublesex (dsx). Female spliced tra transcripts (traF) give rise to Tra proteins that direct splicing of dsxF mRNAs, production of DsxF proteins and female development. When tra is spliced into the male variant, no Tra proteins are produced. This results in splicing of male dsxM mRNAs, DsxM proteins and male development. A: Sex in the honeybee (A. mellifera) is determined by the heterozygosity or homo-/hemizygosity of the csd gene. In females, different Csd proteins, derived from a heterozygous csd gene, direct the processing of female fem mRNAs (femF) . The fem gene is apparently an orthologue of the tra gene ). Fem protein regulates female splicing of dsx, but also self-sustains the female splicing of fem. In males, inactive Csd proteins that are derived from the same alleles (homo- or hemizygous csd genes) result in a default splicing of fem (femM). (B and C) Models of two alternative sex determination systems that co-exist in M. domestica populations , . B: Sex is determined by the absence/presence of an unidentified male-determiner M. In the absence of M, maternally-derived Md-tra gene products establish an auto-regulative loop in females in which Md-Tra protein mediates the production of more female Md-tra mRNA. Presence of M impairs this tra auto-regulatory loop and also mediates the splicing of male Md-tra mRNAs. C: Sex in M. domestica can also be determined by a female determiner. Presence/absence of a tra allele, Md-traD(=FD), determines sexual fate. In females, the presence of Md-traD leads to female splice products and Md-Tra protein, even in the presence of the male-determiner M . In males, the male-determiner M mediates male Md-traM mRNAs in the absence of the Md-traD allele. D: Sex in C. capitata ,  is determined by presence/absence of a, thus far, unidentified male-determiner M. In the absence of M, maternally-derived Cc-tra gene products appear to establish a Cc-tra auto-regulative loop . Presence of M mediates the splicing of male Cc-tra transcripts (traM). E: Sex in D. melanogaster is determined by the dose of X chromosomes , . Double doses of X in females activate the Sxl gene and expression of Sxl proteins. Sxl proteins direct splicing of female traF mRNAs that give rise to functional proteins. Sxl proteins also establish an auto-regulatory feedback loop by directing splicing of productive female SxlF mRNAs, which maintain the female state throughout development. In addition, there is an additional feedback activity in which Tra proteins stimulate Sxl positive auto-regulation . In males, the single dose of X chromosomes does not direct early Sxl protein expression. As a consequence the downstream regulatory decisions do not occur and male dsxM is produced.

Trends Mol Med. ;21(1):43-51.",,,Seeing through VEGF: Innate and adaptive immunity in pathologic angiogenesis in the eye.,"Depending on their activation state, macrophages/microglia can differentially modulate endothelial cell growth. M1 macrophages are anti-angiogenic, whereas M2 macrophages promote angiogenesis. The effect of macrophages on endothelial cells can be contact-dependent or through secretion of angiogenic factors. Complement factor B (cfB), a component of the alternative complement pathway, in combination with the complement inhibitor (CD55), selectively inhibits pathological neovessel formation. In hypoxic conditions, CD55 is downregulated in endothelial cells therefore allowing the specific targeting of neovessels by cfB. Complement components can also modulate macrophage activation. Complement components C3 and C5 polarize macrophages to an M1 anti-angiogenic phenotype. Activation of microglial cells upon exposure to ischemia induces the secretion of IL-1Œ≤ and subsequent production of Semaphorin-3a (Sema-3A) by retinal neurons. Sema-3A induces degeneration of the retinal vasculature. The adaptive immunity may promote angiogenesis through autoantibodies or secretion of IL-17 by T cells.

All bile acids are derived from cholesterol, a 27-carbon molecule. In early fish, e.g., hagfish and sea lamprey, a 7Œ±-hydrocholesterol is converted to 5Œ±-bile alcohols, followed by conversion to 5Œ±-bile alcohol sulfate. The production of bile salts in mammals, birds, cartilaginous fish, and in some teleost and amphibians is dependent on the conversion of 7Œ±-hydrocholesterol into 5Œ≤-bile alcohol. In cartilaginous fish, mainly, but also in some teleost and amphibians, 5Œ≤-bile alcohol is further converted to 5Œ≤-bile alcohol sulfates (‚ÄúLater pathway‚Äù). In mammals and birds, as depicted in the ‚ÄúRecent pathway,‚Äù bile salt production involves the conversion of 5Œ≤-bile alcohol to 24-carbon bile acids in the liver (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) by cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation. When these bile acids are secreted into the lumen of the intestine, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are converted, by colonic bacteria, to the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, respectively. While secondary bile acids in higher concentrations are potentially toxic to cells, they can, together with primary bile acids, be taken up into the blood stream and liver for re-secretion. In all pathways, the production of 7Œ±-hydroxylation is the rate-limiting step in these reactions. Figure based on Ekins et al.

F1000 Biol Rep. 2009;1:8.,2009.0,Regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling functions,Regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway: from laboratory bench to bedside and back again.,"mTOR complex (mTORC)1 regulates protein synthesis in cycling cells by promoting cap-dependent mRNA translation, and the assembly of actively translating poly-ribosomes (polysomes). The signaling functions of mTORC1 are tightly controlled by growth factors, amino acids, and bioenergetic molecules, including oxygen and ATP. Growth factor receptors communicate with mTORC1 by activating phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). A key target for PI3K is the AGC family kinase AKT, which is phosphorylated at Thr308 in the activation loop (AL) by PI3K-dependent kinase-1. Full activation of AKT requires a second phosphorylation event at Ser473 in the hydrophobic motif (HM), which is carried out by mTORC2. mTORC2 is also responsible for a third phosphorylation event at Thr450 in the turn motif (TM), which promotes AKT signaling by increasing the stability of this protein kinase. The signaling functions of mTORC2 are stimulated by direct binding to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 and TSC2 heterodimer (TSC1/2), and possibly by an undefined signal generated by PI3K. Once activated, AKT phosphorylates TSC2, which inhibits TSC1/2-associated GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, leading to increased levels of mTORC1-activating, GTP-bound Rheb. Conversely, hypoxia and ATP depletion (revealed by an increase in the AMP:ATP ratio) stimulate TSC1/2 GAP activity via induction of REDD1 (Regulated in Development and DNA Damage Responses-1) and AMPK activities, respectively. Genotoxic stress-induced p53 activity also stimulates TSC1/2 GAP activity via induction of Sestrins, which bind to and stimulate AMPK. Finally, amino acids activate mTORC1 by inducing the assembly of Rag heterodimers (e.g., the RagA-RagC heterodimers shown in the figure). Deregulated mTORC1 activity promotes the synthesis of proteins that drive inappropriate cell survival and growth, and supports tumor progression. The inset box shows the newly defined, Fbxw7-dependent mechanism that mediates mTOR ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Loss of the tumor suppressor Fbxw7 stabilizes mTOR and promotes elevated mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities in cancer cells.",/pmc/articles/PMC2920679/figure/fig-001/,PMC2920679,1757-594X-0001-0000000008-g001.jpg

The cell cycle is divided into four phases: DNA replication (S), mitosis (M), and two gap phases (G1 and G2, between M/S and S/M, respectively). Some plant cells may skip the M phase under certain developmental processes, resulting ‚Äúendoreduplication.‚Äù Cell cycle starts in G1. During this phase, Glc and auxin signals could induce the expression of CycD, while auxin is also able to increase CDKA transcription. The CycD/CDKA complex is activated by phosphorylation but can still be blocked by CDK inhibitor KRPs. Auxin was reported to reduce the expression of some KRPs. The active CycD/CDKA complex provokes phosphorylation of the transcriptional repressor RBR, and release the transcription regulator E2FA/B and DPA complex. By post-transcriptional regulation, auxin stabilizes the E2FA/B and DPA complex, which promote the expression of genes essential for the beginning of the S phase. The expression of CycA3 could be up-regulated by Glc signal, which is required to drive the cells from G1 to S phase. Auxin was shown to increase the degradation of the F-box SKP2 later in S phase, which indirectly stabilizes E2FC/DPB complex, and represses the S phase genes expression. As cell cycle processes into G2 phase, Glc signal was found to initiate the G2/M transition by repressing TSS transcription, and activating the expression of key cell cycle genes, such as CycB and CycD. Auxin signal is required for the initiation and completion of mitosis, probably though an unknown pathway independent or in parallel to Glc. Auxin is also likely to emit a negative signal to prevent cell from going into endoreduplication hence sustaining cell divisions.

This process facilitates repair by allowing access to the repair machinery, while simultaneously preventing polyadenylation of aborted nascent mRNAs, which are eliminated by exosome-mediated degradation in a nuclear surveillance pathway. Alternatively, the RNAP II complexes arrested at certain DNA lesions are not degraded, CSA and CSB proteins regulate the recruitment of chromatin remodeling and TCR factors (), and then RNAP II re-engages and continues transcription once repair is completed.

Mature miRNAs use imperfect complementarity to guide Argonaute-containing (ALG-1 or ALG-2) miRISC to inhibit target mRNA expression. In the exo-RNAi pathway, long exogenous dsRNAs are recognized by RDE-4 and cleaved by the Dicer complex into primary exo-siRNAs, which recruit the Argonaute RDE-1 and other RISC factors to bind complementary sequences in target mRNAs. Amplification of primary siRNAs can generate secondary exo-siRNAs by the RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) RRF-1, which uses the previously targeted mRNA as a template. The newly synthesized siRNAs contain 5‚Ä≤ triphosphates and form RISC complexes with the Secondary Argonautes (SAGOs) or the Argonaute CSR-1.

Dopamine transmission directs the activation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (D1R and D2R, respectively) in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. On the WT postsynaptic density of a D1 synapse, D1Rs activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) in MSNs, whereas muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 (M4R) inhibits AC activity. In contrast, D2Rs negatively regulate AC in MSNs, while A2ARs are AC agonists. GPR3 activates AC in both D1R and D2R-expressing MSNs, where RGS2 is a target of cAMP signaling. Activation of AC is upstream of cAMP and PKA, which augments NMDAR activity.

The ComS pre-peptide is exported and processed via an unknown mechanism (denoted as a dotted line and gray box) into XIP. In a chemically defined, peptide-poor medium (CDM) XIP is re-imported via oligopeptide permease (Opp) and binds ComR. The ComR/XIP complex binds upstream of comS and sigX at PComR-box sites []. The alternative sigma factor, SigX, facilitates RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding at Pcin-box sites []. Genes regulated by SigX include the DNA-uptake and transformasome machinery as well as the murein hydrolase, LytFsm, among others [,]. Non-specific peptides present in high concentrations in peptide-rich media are thought to prevent intracellular transport of XIP via Opp []. Recently, a link between the bacteriocin and competence pathways was determined to be mediated by SigX at a Pcin-box site upstream of blpRH (formerly referred to as comDE, see ). The BlpRH QS pathway pheromone, MIP, is exported and processed by the ABC transporter complex NlmTE into the 21 amino-acid long precursor peptide, MIP-21 []. Cleavage of MIP-21 by the protease SepM results in fully active MIP-18 []. MIP-18 is thought to bind to BlpH, resulting in activation and phosphorylation of BlpR similarly to CSP binding and activation of ComDE in S. pneumoniae []. BlpR~P binds at PBlpR-box sites upstream of bacteriocin loci such as cipB and nlmAB, among others []. Although the mechanism is unknown (represented by the dotted circle surrounding CipB), the activity of CipB is required for the indirect induction of SigX observed when cells are grown in peptide-rich media and treated with MIP [,,]. Multiple other regulatory pathways are observed to feed into the ComRS/BlpRH QS networks, such as the CiaHR, HdrRM, and the RcrRPQ systems [,,,,,].

E2, tamoxifen (TAM) or G1 activate the G-protein Coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER) distributed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. Activation of GPER located in the plasma membrane stimulates steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) through a GŒ≤Œ≥-subunit protein pathway. The Œ≤ and Œ≥ subunits of the G protein activate the SRC tyrosine kinase, which binds to the integrin Œ±ŒΩŒ≤1 through the SHC adapter protein. The complex activates the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which then cleaves the pro-heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF) and releases the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) into the extracellular space. The free HB-EGF then transactivates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Phosphorylation of EGFR in turn activates the downstream pathways, which can induce rapid non-genomic effects, or genomic effects regulating different genes transcription and leads to cell survival and proliferation.

Glucose uptake results in fermentation processes via activation of high efficient Pyk1p and thus a rapid turnover of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway by triose phosphate isomerase causes an increase in NADP+, but not in NADPH. High glucose activates Adh1/3/4/5p which forces the formation of ethanol upon fermentation processes. Additionally, glucose represses Adh2p and thus inhibits the vice-versa production of acetaldehyde from ethanol. Ethanol, galactose and glycerol stimulate expression of the less active Pyk2p, which furthermore enhances intracellular levels of PEP. Enhanced PEP leads to an activation of the PPP, increases respiratory metabolism via pyruvate and acetyl-CoA intermediates. Malate is converted to pyruvate by mitochondrial Mae1p and thereby reductive NADPH is synthesized. Upon strict carbon starvation metabolic fluxes are restricted. At the same time, stress response mechanisms and autophagy are induced, which ultimately results in longevity.

Ju et al. determined an intricate form of crosstalk between HER2 and Notch-1 in HER2+ breast cancer. HER2+ breast cancer cells exhibit an increase in survivin protein expression concomitantly with a decrease in survivin mRNA expression. HER2 promotes activation of the AKT pathway, which threonine 308 phosphorylated AKT can inhibit p21-mediated inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) dimerization to cyclin B1. Concomitantly, HER2-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway enables Erk-mediated CDK1-Cyclin B1 dimerization as well as inhibition of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of survivin by restricting the formation of the X-linked Inhibitor of apoptosis protein-X-linked associating factor-1(XIAP-XAF-1) complex. Together, AKT and Erk promote dimerization of CDK1 to Cyclin B1, which stabilizes survivin by phosphorylating the threonine 34 residue (Thr34) of the survivin protein. Increased survivin stabilization causes an increase in survivin expression. Survivin mRNA is reduced by Erk-mediated inhibition of Œ≥-secretase, which in turn inhibits Notch receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. (B) Pradeep et al. established an interesting form of crosstalk between the HER2 and Notch-3 receptors in HER2+ DCIS.

DDK then activates the 53BP1/RIF1 complex, which plays a role in shielding the broken ends from resection by antagonizing BRCA1/CtIP activity. DNA-PK also activates other KU-recruited proteins, such as XLF, XRCC4 and Lig4, for ligating the broken ends. In the HDR pathway, DSB formation induces cell cycle arrest initiated with the activation of ATM resulting from sensing a chromatin structure change. Activated monomeric ATM then phosphorylates the MRN complex and P53/SOG1, which regulates the cell cycle checkpoint and arrest. MRN activation supports end resection for HDR. Limited resection leads to MMEJ, and if a substantial level of resection is formed in the absence of a donor template, SSA is likely to be used for the repair. MMEJ requires PARP and Pol Q for its processes, and SSA requires the role of RAD52. Both MMEJ and SSA require the ssDNA flap endonuclease FEN1 and Lig3/Lig1:XRCC1 for ligating final products. Extensive resection of the broken ends is facilitated by Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) and/or Dna2. In the presence of donor template, the 3‚Ä≤ overhangs of resected ends could be protected by RPA binding and then recruiting RAD51 to the ssDNA with support and control by BRCA2. RAD51 binds to the resected ssDNA overhang, forming nucleoprotein filaments or presynaptic filaments. With the support of RAD54, the filament structure invades the donor template sequence and searches for and anneals to the complementary sequence; then, displacement loop (D-loop) formation occurs. Subsequently, the free 3‚Ä≤ OH end of the invaded ssDNA primes donor template-dependent DNA synthesis. This process determines the outcomes of HDR with several sub-pathways (DSBR with dHJ and SDSA) with the supportive activity of RAD5A, RECQ4A and MUS81.

The sterol-stage occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum.

For sake of simplicity only the Bloch pathway is shown in its totality. Substrates have similar structures for each pathway but the shunt pathway has a epoxy group in the side-chain (blue arrow) while the enzyme DHCR24 removes the Œî24 double bond of any CBI (blue arrow in lanosterol) to produce the intermediates of the Kandutsch-Russell pathway. The preferred substrate of DHCR24 is 7,24-cholestadien-3Œ≤-ol (red segmented arrow).The removal of methyl groups at C4 from T-MAS requires two cycles of processing by the enzymes SC4MOL, NSDHL and HSD17B7.

Integrin signals have been well documented to include a pathway that leads to activation of Rac1 activity, such as through the p130Cas and Crk pathway. Such activation of Rac1 is closely related to plasma membrane ruffling and enhanced cell motility. Our results suggest that integrin signals also include a pathway that evokes a mechanism to down-regulate Rac1 activity at the cell‚Äìcell contact areas of the cell periphery, in which the presence of Fak and paxillin appears to be essential. Paxillin participates in efficient FA recruitment of Fak, and Tyr861 phosphorylation may be important for Fak function. Such localized down-regulation of Rac1 activity appears to be crucial for the maintenance of the normal morphology and normal dynamics of the plasma membrane, the formation of N-cadherin‚Äìbased cell‚Äìcell adhesions, and perhaps also for the maintenance of N-cadherin‚Äìbased cell‚Äìcell adhesions in the collective migration of HeLa cells.

In the signal-sending cell (top), endocytosis of Notch ligands (violet) is needed for their productive signaling activity. Ligand endocytosis generates the physical forces needed to dissociate and activate Notch receptors in nascent invaginating endocytic vesicles, and it might also concentrate ligand molecules through their trafficking and/or post-translational modification in the recycling compartment. In the signal-receiving cell (bottom), Notch receptors (blue) are internalized into endocytic vesicles and subsequently routed to early endosomes. Ligand-activated Notch is sorted into multivesicular bodies and thence to lysosomes for degradation; non-ligand-activated Notch can undergo trafficking to the cell surface via recycling endosomes. The identities of various endocytic factors involved in these trafficking steps are shown near their approximate sites of activity; those that promote signaling are indicated in green whereas those involved in signaling down-regulation are indicated in red. The Œ≥-secretase-mediated cleavage of Notch that generates the active signaling fragment NICD can occur at different points in the endosomal trafficking pathway (see text for details).",/pmc/articles/PMC2731830/figure/F1/,PMC2731830,nihms112315f1.jpg

The cell cycle of ES cells is shortened relative to that of Œ≤ cells. An abbreviated G1 phase is responsible for the difference in cell cycle length. a In Œ≤ cells, mitogen signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activates CDK4‚Äìcyclin D kinase activity, thus hypophosphorylating retinoblastoma protein (pRB), which then leads to release of E2F, allowing it to activate transcription of genes necessary in the progression of the cell cycle. b In ES cells, mitogen signaling through the MAPK pathway seems to be irrelevant in the progression of cell cycle. Cyclin E‚ÄìCDK2 expression is cell cycle-independent and constitutively active throughout the cell cycle, which allows the transition of ES cells from M phase directly to late G1. The resulting absence of the cyclin D-dependent early G1 phase shortens the G1 phase and the entire cell cycle. In beta cells, cyclin D‚ÄìCDK4 is highly active but cyclin E‚ÄìCDK2 is absent, making the cell cycle between these two cells highly different",/pmc/articles/PMC4711007/figure/Fig1/,PMC4711007,13287_2015_274_Fig1_HTML.jpg

The most important complement components are marked with (*) when they are possible biomarkers in plasma and with (**) when they represent biomarkers in CSF. Complement system activation and the C5b-9 terminal complex, when present at lytic doses, lead to demyelination. In contrast, sublytic C5b-9 can protect OLG from apoptotic cell death, indicating a dual role for complement in demyelination. Human myelin and OLG are vulnerable to complement attack because they lack some of complement surface inhibitors. Classical pathway is usually activated when the C1 complex binds myelin-specific autoantibodies through its C1q component. The C1s-induced cleavage of C2 and C4 results in the generation of the classical pathway C3 convertase C4b2a. Lectin pathway is activated when MBL binds to mannose residues on the surface of a pathogen and activate MASP-2 which leads to the formation of C3 convertase. C3 convertase cleaves the C3 component and the resulting C3b participates in the formation of the C5 convertase, C4b2a3b. In the alternative pathway, factor B bound to the C3b generated through spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 (C3(H2O)) is cleaved by factor D and the resulting Bb fragment forms with C3b the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb, which amplifies the cleavage of C3. C5 convertase acts on C5 which is cleaved into C5a and C5b. C5b initiates the terminal pathway which leads to the formation of C5b-9 terminal complex",/pmc/articles/PMC6563602/figure/F1/,PMC6563602,nihms-1034095-f0001.jpg

An increase in the nutraceutical ALA is hypothesized to markedly increase membrane fluidity leading to the efficient formation of lipid rafts [] in neuronal plasma membranes. Lipid rafts are the functional domains of the plasma membrane and play a crucial role in the regulation of transmembrane signaling []. TrkB receptors and some NMDA receptors are constituents of lipid rafts [‚Äì] and one of the major nonprotein components of lipid rafts is cholesterol []. The enhanced formation and/or efficiency of transmembrane signaling is hypothesized to result in enhanced activation (phosphorylation) of NMDA and TrkB receptors via the binding of BDNF to its cognate receptor, TrkB. Activation of NMDA receptors results in enhanced calcium influx and activation of signal transduction pathways leading to activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Œ∫B) via the canonical pathway (phosphorylation of I-Œ∫B leads to its dissociation from the dimer (p65/p50) which then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to Œ∫B sites to regulate gene expression) which in turn increases BDNF mRNA and protein levels [‚Äì]. Enhanced intracellular BDNF protein expression would lead to an increase in secretion, thereby maintaining its availability to bind to TrkB in an autocrine fashion [, ] as well as to stimulate neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and synaptic function at distant sites (paracrine function).",/pmc/articles/PMC4350958/figure/fig2/,PMC4350958,BMRI2015-519830.002.jpg

During this import process, the substrates is hydrolyzed to fatty acids and CoA and released into the peroxisomal matrix. Such a transport mode requires the intra‚Äêperoxisomal ATP‚Äêdependent re‚Äêesterification to CoA for fatty acid activation. The peroxisomal ATP carrier PNC import cytosolic ATP in exchange with AMP, which is produced during fatty acid activation. ATP is also required for other ATP‚Äêdependent reaction inside peroxisomes, including auxin biosynthesis, protein phosphorylation and mevalonate pathway. NAD‚Äêdependent reactions inside peroxisomes, like fatty acid oxidation, depend on the import of NAD from the cytosol catalyzed by the peroxisomal NAD carrier PXN. The exchange partner for the NAD uptake is generated by peroxisomal NADH hydrolysis. NAD can be phosphorylated to NADPH, which is the cofactor for NADP‚Äêdependent ICDH and the OPPP enzymes G6PDH and 6‚ÄêPGDH. In addition, peroxisomes require a peroxisomal CoA carrier (PCC) mediating the uptake of CoA, which has not been identified for plant peroxisomes. If the CoA is cleaved off at the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane during the transport of acyl‚ÄêCoA, the peroxisomal CoA carrier imports cytosolic CoA into peroxisomes required for fatty acid activation. Peroxisomal CoA is also used to remove acetyl‚ÄêCoA from the fatty acyl chain in the last step of Œ≤‚Äêoxidation, whereas the glyoxylate cycle produces free CoA. To regulate CoA homeostasis, CoA can be hydrolyzed to PAP or 4‚ÄêPP, which are suitable counter‚Äêexchange substrates for the CoA import. The further hydrolysis of PAP yields AMP, another putative export substrate for the peroxisomal CoA carrier. Other intermediates of the peroxisomal metabolism, such as organic acids, might be shuttled via the peroxisomal channel protein called PMP22 across the peroxisomal membrane. Pex11 as a second channel might be involved in the uptake of free fatty acids into the peroxisomes, as a redundant system to the peroxisomal ABC transporter. Other compartments of a plant cell, like plastids and mitochondria, possess a large variety of transporter and channel proteins for shuttling metabolites across their bilayer membranes, including the outer envelope proteins OEPs, plastidial MCF‚Äêtype carriers, plastidial PMP22‚Äêtype channels, voltage‚Äêdependent anion channels (VDACs), mitochondrial MCF carriers, and mitochondrial PMP22‚Äêtype channels.

We suggest that at the stalled replication fork, the Rad6-Rad18-dependent PCNA ubiquitylation and the USP1-dependent PCNA deubiquitylation are dynamic processes, of which balance determines the life-time of ubiquitin-PCNA and the choice of fork rescue mechanism. In the absence of ubiquitin-PCNA, replication fork can be rescued by recombination-dependent mechanisms, which, however, have a potential for DNA rearrangements. In the presence of ubiquitin-conjugated-PCNA, damage bypass or template switching can provide replication through the lesion without the formation of a DSB intermediate. Spartan can provide one regulatory level by binding to ubiquitin-modified PCNA, which protects against PCNA deubiquitylation by USP1. Thus, Spartan can channel the reviving of stalled replication from a recombination-dependent pathway that does not require PCNA ubiquitylation to PCNA ubiquitylation-dependent translesion synthesis or PCNA polyubiquitylation-dependent template switching pathways.",/pmc/articles/PMC3510514/figure/gks850-F6/,PMC3510514,gks850f6p.jpg

Adenosine is strongly immunosuppressive affecting almost all the immune cells. In non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) the EGFR mutation is able to make a similar condition []. b The detailed action of adenosine on T regulatory cells (Treg), and T effector cells (Teff). Adenosine, binding the A2A receptor (A2AR), is able to expand and activate Treg cells increasing the nuclear expression of FoxP3; at the same time inactivating Teff cells through the increase of CTLA-4 and PD-1 expression, and decrease of IL-2 production and CD25 expression, proliferation, TH1 and TH2 development, TH17 generation. The result of these pleotropic effects of adenosine is a ‚Äústuck‚Äù TME with high number of activated Treg cells and exhausted T cells. c In the immune suppressed TME induced by adenosine, anti-PD-1 is able to remove the blockade caused by the activation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and Teff cells can kill melanoma cells. In NSCLC, the EGFR mutation is also responsible for the low expression IFN-Œ≥ signature [] contributing at the low effect of anti-PD-1 in this group of patients. d Higher dosage of ipilimumab (low dosage of ipilimumab does not seem to affect the TME []), or the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab, may trigger an ADCC mechanism of action removing the activated Treg cells and improving the action of ipilimumab as single agent or in combination with nivolumab where there is the additional important activation of Teff cells mediated by anti-PD-1",/pmc/articles/PMC5549368/figure/Fig1/,PMC5549368,12967_2017_1278_Fig1_HTML.jpg

PTH signaling through PTH1R activates the phospholipase C (PLC) and adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA) pathways. PKA activation stimulates the upregulation of Jagged 1 (JAG1), which signals through Notch receptors on adjacent cells, for example, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), in which the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is cleaved by Œ≥-secretase and translocates to the nucleus in which it acts as a transcription factor promoting self-renewal. Bone morphogenic protein (BMP) binds to BMP receptors A and B on osteoblasts and promotes quiescence in HSCs. Wnt is produced and secreted by osteoblasts. Wnt‚Äôs receptor on HSC is frizzled in conjunction with the coreceptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5. A signaling pathway following Wnt binding of the receptor culminates in Œ≤-catenin translocating to the nucleus and regulating genes involved in self-renewal. Osteoblasts also produce Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) an inhibitor of Wnt signaling. The receptor tyrosine kinase TIE2 is expressed on HSCs and its ligand angiopoietin 1 (ANG-1) is expressed by osteoblasts.

Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFŒ±) may continually induce the activation of caspase-8, caspase-3, and DNA fragmentation through membrane receptors. This apoptotic pathway, called the extrinsic pathway, is a direct activation of caspases. Intracellular metabolic disturbances or excess reactive oxygen species can hurt mitochondria and result in cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation. The activated caspase-9 further stimulates caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Because this type of apoptosis is from mitochondrion-mediated activation of caspases, it is thus named mitochondrial-dependent pathway or mitochondrial pathway. Sometimes, it is also called indirect pathway or intrinsic pathway. Mitochondrial dependent pathway is different from extrinsic apoptotic pathway, but two pathways are not mutually exclusive in liver. The mitochondrial pathway is very important during hepatic apoptosis, which is often required to amplify the relatively weak death receptor-induced apoptotic signal.

A variety of functions act at the cell surface to sense potential signals of relevance to mammalian hosts. These include iron sensing via the high affinity uptake system (Cft1-Cfo1), the ESCRT pathway and master iron regulator Cir1. The ESCRT pathway also participates in the pH-response RIM pathway. In response to alkaline pH, Rim101 is phosphorylated by PKA, cleaved by the protease Rim13, and relocalized to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of genes involved in cell wall remodeling. The cAMP/PKA and HOG pathways have opposing influences on capsule formation. In presence of glucose, cAMP activates PKA, which in turns phosphorylate the transcription factor Nrg1 that promotes expression of capsule synthesis gene and represses transcription of PBS2 and HOG1. Capsule enlargement requires increase mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity, which generate increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS triggers Hog1 activation via its phosphorylation by Pbs2. Phosphorylated Hog1 translocates to the nucleus and reduces capsule biosynthesis by potentially accelerating mRNA degradation.

BAI1 activates the RhoA pathway by coupling with GŒ± 12/13, although this has only been shown in cultured HEK293T cells and requires confirmation in neurons (red outline). The C-terminal region of BAI1 binds to IRSp53 via its proline-rich region (PRR), but the function of this interaction needs to be further explored. BAI1 also interacts with the Rac1 activator modules ELMO1/DOCK180 (via the Œ±-helical RKR motif (HD)) and Tiam1/Par3 (via the PDZ-binding motif (PBM)). However, only the Tiam1/Par3 interaction is required for BAI1's effects on dendritic spine formation and excitatory synaptogenesis.

In quiescent cells, integrins likely have low affinity for extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (i.e. such as collagen I, fibronectin, etc.. - which are in low abundance) and are therefore in a low affinity or inactive confirmation. Thus, ILK is relatively inactive. In addition, the GŒ±12/13 pathway is inactive (delineated by dotted lines). Upon ligand binding (i.e., collagen I, fibronectin, etc), the confirmation of the integrin changes and ILK binds to the cytoplasmic tail of Œ≤-integrin, resulting in formation of PINCH-ILK-parvin ternary complexes. ILK subsequently recruits other signaling molecules. In stellate cells, ILK is engaged in G-protein receptor signaling cross talk, where it appears to amplify GŒ±12/13 mediated signals. Activation of this ILK/GŒ±12/13 signaling pathway has several functional consequences, including in actin reorganization (and actin synthesis), cell spreading, cell migration, and extracellular matrix synthesis. The pathways leading to synthesis of ECM are likely to be multiple, and likely include both ILK direct pathways, as well as those that cross talk through the GŒ±12/13 and the Rho pathway.

Glutamine contained in culture medium is converted in the cells into glutamate and further in mitochondria into Œ±-ketoglutarate, intermediate of tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glutamate is also a source of proline required for collagen biosynthesis. This pathway of proline supply is sufficient to maintain high collagen biosynthesis rate. An addition of exogenous proline results in slight increase in collagen production. Glutamine deprivation from culture medium contributes to decrease in cellular proline content resulting in down-regulation of collagen biosynthesis. In such a condition, exogenous proline restores intracellular proline pool, providing substrate for collagen biosynthesis. The conversion of proline into glutamate is not significant due to low expression of proline oxidase (POX) in fibroblasts. This hypothesis is supported by proline-dependent regulation of HIF-1Œ± transcriptional activity. Translocation of HIF-1Œ± to nucleus is more pronounced in the absence of glutamine since Œ±-ketoglutarate induces HIF-1Œ± hydroxylation and ubiquitin dependent degradation. Therefore, in the absence of glutamine, Œ±-ketoglutarate production is impaired, contributing to upregulation of HIF-1Œ± transcriptional activity. In contrast, in the presence of glutamine, proline-induced HIF-1Œ± transcriptional activity is attenuated.

Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. ;16(4):221-231.",,,Diversity and selectivity in mRNA translation on the endoplasmic reticulum.,"a | The primary functional unit of translation is the polyribosome, which comprises an mRNA, an array of ribosomes along that mRNA, a series of nascent polypeptide chains in the process of synthesis and a diverse set of associated RNA-binding proteins. A polyribosome may initiate assembly on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by any one of its constituent parts. The well-established mechanism for compartmentalizing translation to the ER is the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway, in which a signal sequence in the nascent polypeptide initiates binding of the ribosome and its elongating polypeptide (). Several other modes of ER association for ribosomes and mRNAs have also been described. Ribosomes may associate with the ER independently of their encoded nascent chain and with mRNAs subsequent to their association with an ER ribosome receptor. In addition, RNA-binding proteins can confer direct, ribosome-independent mRNA binding. This system requires that only one of these components bind to the ER to enable assembly of an entire polyribosome, and it is also possible that a polyribosome is targeted to the ER via multiple mechanisms in parallel. b | A general framework for ribosome and mRNA movement between the cytosol and the ER is depicted. There are essentially two transitions that occur: first, the association of an mRNA and a ribosome to form an active translational unit and the corresponding dissociation; and second the movement of each of these components between the cytosol and the ER. The rate at which each of these transitions occurs would vary depending on the mechanism of ER recruitment. For example, in the SRP pathway (), the sequence of events is initiation in the cytosol, movement of the translation unit to the ER and finally dissociation of the ribosomes from the mRNA and release into the cytosol. In an alternative model, ribosomes bind stably to the ER and undergo many successive rounds of mRNA translation without release to the cytosol; that is, rates of ribosome binding and release would be lower than those of translational units that are targeted by the SRP pathway. Measurement of these rates for different classes of mRNAs and ribosomes will be essential for understanding the relative importance of various mechanisms for recruiting translation to the ER.",/pmc/articles/PMC4494666/figure/F3/,PMC4494666,nihms698706f3.jpg

Expert Rev Respir Med. ;4(4):509-518.",,,Lung cancer in women: role of estrogens.,"Lung cancer cells predominantly express ERŒ≤. The full-length ERŒ±, the primary functional receptor in breast cancer cells, is not expressed in most lung cancer cells and tissues. Instead, they express a variant of ERŒ± that lacks the exon 4 at the amino terminus (which contains the nuclear localization signal. As a result, ERŒ± is expressed in the cytoplasm of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and tissues, while ERŒ≤ predominantly localizes to the cytoplasm and is believed to mediate the transcriptional effects of estrogen in NSCLC. Estrogen (17-Œ≤ estradiol or E2Œ≤) present in the extracellular space diffuses through the cell membrane and binds to cytosolic ERs, Œ± or Œ≤. The ERs in the cytoplasm are normally kept inactive by binding of a complex containing HSP90. Binding with estrogen causes the inhibitory complex to dissociate, thereby activating the receptor. The ligand-bound receptor then either dimerizes and is imported into the nucleus (classical pathway [I] mediated by ERŒ≤) or translocates to the cell membrane where it associates with receptor tyrosine kinases like the EGFR (alternate pathway [II] mediated by either ERŒ± and/or ERŒ≤). The ER proteins have been shown to colocalize in caveolae, which are plasma membrane-associated lipid rafts that provide the appropriate environment for interaction with cell surface receptors like EGFR. This interaction with EGFR forms the basis of employing EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in combination with anti-estrogens (e.g., fulvestrant, a competitive antagonist of estrogen binding to the ER) for the treatment of lung cancer. In the case of ERŒ±, palmitoylation of a cysteine residue (Cys477) is crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane. The activation of EGFR by ERŒ± or Œ≤ (bound to the ligand E2Œ≤) leads to phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc, which in turn associates with the GRB2‚ÄìSOS complex, activating the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. The activated ERK (p44/p42 MAPK) then migrates to the nucleus where it activates the transcription of genes that promote proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells. In addition, the ligand-bound ERŒ≤ receptor, upon translocating to the nucleus, binds directly to gene promoters containing the ERE where it recruits the p160 coactivator GRIP1/TIF2 and thus activates genes that promote cell cycle progression (Id-2 and cyclin D1) and therefore induces proliferation of NSCLC cells.EGFR: EGF receptor; ER: Estrogen receptor; ERE: Estrogen response element; ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GRB: Growth factor receptor-bound protein; GRIP: Glutamate receptor interacting protein; HSP: Heat-shock protein; SOS: Son of sevenless.",/pmc/articles/PMC2928145/figure/F1/,PMC2928145,nihms-226924-f0001.jpg

S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of mSin1 at Thr-86 and Thr-398 results in dissociation of mSin1 from mTORC2 thus impairing the overall mTORC2 activity and subsequently diminishing Akt activation level. S6K1 could also regulate mTORC2 activity by phosphorylating Rictor, another component of mTORC2. Following mTORC1-dependent activation, S6K1 phosphorylates Rictor at Thr-1135. Phosphorylation of Rictor at Thr-1135 results in inhibition of Akt activity. S6K1 also inhibits Akt-mTORC1 activity by phosphorylating IRS-1 on Ser-302, which results in disruption of the interaction between IRS-1 and insulin receptor and subsequent inhibition of PI3K-mediated Akt activation.

Rubisco has two sites of carboxylation and oxygenation. Elevated CO2 (eCO2) may promote carboxylation, but repress oxygenation under ample environmental conditions, such as well-watering, whereas extreme abiotic stress, such as heat and drought, may repress carboxylation but promote oxygenation (; ). An energy consumption trade-off between the key cycles may occur, possibly modified by the CO2 level, in which photorespiration may be promoted to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS), related to glutamine synthetase (GS2) to recycle ammonia, diminishing photo-oxidation and photo-inhibition (dotted orange line ellipse; ; ). A low Gly:Ser ratio provides evidence that photorespiration is repressed in eCO2 (). Water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), despite the N dilution, should be enhanced by elevated CO2, by decreasing stomatal conductance and investing relatively more N into the Rubisco protein ().

Oncogene. ;29(9):1249-1259.",,Schematic model of regulatory pathways involved in Mycn stabilization,Myc proteins as therapeutic targets.,"Schematic model of regulatory pathways involved in Mycn stabilization. In proliferating cells, Mycn is initially phosphorylated at serine 62 by cyclin-dependent kinase 1/CyclinB. The S62-phosphorylated protein is stabilized and competent to enter the nucleus. Nuclear Mycn binds to its partner, the helix-loop-helix transcription factor Max and stimulates the transcription of a target genes important in cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. This priming phosphorylation at S62 allows the binding of Gsk3Œ≤, as well as Pin1 and PP2A in a complex also containing Axin. Active Gsk3Œ≤ phosphorylates Mycn at threonine 58, producing doubly phosphorylated, stabilized and transcriptionally active Mycn. In a Pin1-mediated process, PP2A dephosphorylates the S62 phosphate, enabling binding of ubiquitin ligase Fbw7. Fbw7 subsequently drives poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Mycn. Aurora A kinase can bind to and stabilize polyubiquitinated/phosphorylated Mycn, potentially leaving it competent to bind to Max and activate transcription. In this model, upstream signaling starts at the membrane with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are either activated by ligand or by constitutively activating mutations (in Alk, for example). RTKs activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 then binds to Akt, localizing it to the membrane and allowing the phosphorylation and activation of Akt by membrane bound Pdk1 at threonine 308. Active Akt then phosphorylates Glycogen synthase kinase 3Œ≤ (Gsk3Œ≤) and inactivates it, blocking Gsk3Œ≤-mediated phosphorylation of Mycn T58 and thereby stabilizing Mycn. Akt also activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through several indirect signaling mechanisms including through Tsc2/Tsc1 and Rheb. mTOR exists in two distinct complexes. mTORC1 complex, the rapamycin sensitive form, consists of mTOR bound to multiple effector proteins, including Raptor and Lst8, and is important for the promotion of global translation through S6K and 4EBP. mTORC1 also directly phosphorylates and inhibits PP2A, enabling the accumulation of doubly phosphorylated, active Mycn and contributing to the general proliferation-promoting downstream effects of the PI3K/Akt/Mycn pathway (). The mTORC2 complex, also known as Pdk2, contains mTOR, rictor, Lst8 and mSin1. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at serine 473 further activating this kinase. Inhibitors of this pathway could potentially destabilize Mycn. These inhibitors are currently in clinical trials or in clinical development and are denoted by red octagons. The Aurora A Kinase inhibitor is denoted by an orange octagon, which represents targeted kinase inhibition, but no anticipated activity against Mycn itself.

Stomata closure and cold acclimation are two effects caused by exposure to low temperature. In order to reach these responses, some transducers to the cold signal have been described as it is illustrated in this figure. In the case of the stomata closure, information about a decrease in water availability at the plant root due to low temperatures is sensed by the guard cells that close in order to avoid water loss. Acclimation, the other response triggered by cold exposure is very complex, since it includes metabolic and genetic reprogramming that lead to membrane remodeling and synthesis of anti-freezing or crio-protecting molecules. As a result, plants later withstand freezing temperatures. Stomata closure requires MPK9/12. Since cold stress promotes rapid production of PA through PLDŒ¥ activation, as well as the joint action of PLC and DGK, it is suggested that these enzymes function upstream of an MPK9/MPK12 cascade, as in the case of ABA-induced stomata closure. Furthermore, it has been shown that during cold acclimation, there is an increase in LCB-Ps upstream of MPK6, which can then regulate ROS accumulation mediated by tAPX in the chloroplast.

Class I melanomas behave similarly to BRAF V600-mutant melanomas in that they are highly sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibition. B. Class II pan-negative melanomas are activated by ERBB receptors, which activate both MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, making them less susceptible to MEK1/2 inhibition than Class I melanomas, but more susceptible to combined inhibition of ERBBs and MEK1/2. A potential mechanism for the ERBB activity in Class II's is the relative lack of DUSP4 expression, presumably allowing ERK1/2-mediated transcription of ERBB ligands such as amphiregulin (AREG). C. This pie chart displays the breakdown of driver events that sustain melanoma.

Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes. Cyp7a1 is the first and rate‚Äêlimiting enzyme in the classic bile acid synthesis pathway to synthesize CA and CDCA. Cyp8b1 is required for synthesis of CA. Cyp27a1 is involved in steroid side‚Äêchain oxidation. The alternative pathway is initiated by Cyp27a1, followed by Cyp7b1. Bile acids are conjugated to amino acids glycine and taurine for secretion into bile. In mice, CDCA is converted to Œ±‚Äê and Œ≤‚Äêmuricholic acids. CDCA activates FXR to induce a negative factor, SHP, which inhibits Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 gene transcription. Bile acids are stored in the gallbladder and secreted into the gastrointestinal tract for nutrient absorption. In the intestine, conjugated bile acids are deconjugated by bacterial BSH and bacterial 7‚Äêdehydroxylase activities convert CA and CDCA to DCA and LCA, respectively. In the ileum, FXR induces FGF15 (or human FGF19). Bile acids and FGF15/FGF19 are secreted into portal blood for circulation to the liver. In hepatocytes, FGF15 and FGF19 activate the FGF receptor 4/Œ≤‚ÄêKlotho complex to activate cJun/ERK1/2 of the MAPK pathway to inhibit Cyp7a1 gene transcription. Conjugated bile acid‚Äêactivated S1PR2 may also be involved in inhibiting Cyp7a1. In NAFLD and NASH, hepatic bile acid and lipid metabolisms are impaired to accumulate toxic bile acids and lipids along with cholestatic liver injury. Ceramides and diacylglycerols have been linked to insulin resistance in diabetes. FGF19 and M70 inhibit bile acid synthesis and reduce bile acid hydrophobicity. FGF19 and M70 stimulate fatty acid oxidation and inhibit fatty acid synthesis to reduce lipogenesis, ceramides, and diacylglycerol and to increase unoxidized‚Äêcardiolipins in mitochondria; reduced ROS reduces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (CCl2, Ccr2, IL‚Äê1Œ≤, Tnf‚ÄêŒ±), fibrosis markers (Col1a1, Timp2), and apoptosis markers (Bax, Bad).

Glucose brought across the plasma-membrane by glucose transporters is rapidly phosphorylated by HK-2 bound to VDAC located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. VDAC channels ATP generated by the ATP Synthasome complex (ATP synthase; adenine nucleotide translocator, ANT; inorganic phosphate carrier, PiC) on the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating direct access of ATP to VDAC-bound HK-2. To maintain the high rate of glycolytic metabolism in tumors, and their proliferation capacity, the product G-6-P rapidly distributes primarily across two key metabolic routes; (a) entry of G-6-P into the pentose‚Äìphosphate shunt for biosynthesis of nucleic-acid precursors, and (b) conversion of the G-6-P via the glycolytic pathway to pyruvic acid. Most of the pyruvic acid is reduced to lactic acid and transported out of the tumor cell via lactate transporters {B}. This promotes an unfavorable environment for the surrounding normal cells with concomitant regeneration of NAD+ within the cells to maintain glycolysis. Some pyruvate is directed to mitochondria across VDAC and via the ‚Äúas-yet-uncharacterized‚Äù pyruvate transporter on the inner mitochondrial membrane {A}. This provides substrates for the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy generation, as well as lipid and amino acid biosynthesis (not shown).",/pmc/articles/PMC2714668/figure/F1/,PMC2714668,nihms-115209-f0001.jpg

One of the pathways that DAG can be produced is linked to the rise of intracellular calcium concentration, which leads to the production of DAG through an as-yet-unknown pathway. The main source of intracellular calcium post-synaptically is considered to be due to depolarisation () induced entry through L-type VGCCs. A minor source of Ca is due to the leak flux from the ER. Ca exits the cytoplasm through PMCA and SERCA pumps. Once 2-AG is synthesised, it is released by a putative eCB membrane transporter and activates CB receptors, found pre-synaptically (on the inhibitory cell). This results in the splitting of the G protein heterotrimer into G and G subunits. The G subunit directly inhibits the N-type VGCCs on the pre-synaptic membrane, which puts them into a reluctant state, resulting in the inhibition of GABA neurotransmitter release. 2-AG is then returned into the cells by an as-yet-unknown eCB transporter where most of it is degraded by MGL. Post-synaptically, 2-AG undergoes oxidation by COX-2.

(a) Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) stimulates carcinogenesis in colonic epithelium through the BFT toxin. This toxin leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inducing spermine oxidase expression via c-Myc. Likewise, BFT cuts E-cadherin, thus activating Œ≤ catenin which stimulates cellular proliferation. BFT also modulates the host's immune response by promoting Treg lymphocytes to polarize the response to Th17 lymphocytes, thus increasing IL-17 secretion which in turn, activates NF-Œ∫B in the colonic epithelium; this results in the secretion of the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 that recruit MDSC, thus favoring evasion from the immune response. The presence of ETBF has also been associated with STAT3 activation. (b). Salmonella enterica releases two proteins that promote carcinogenesis: the typhoid toxin that induces cellular proliferation, and the AvrA protein that is internalized via the Type 3 Secretion System(T3SS). AvrA activates the Œ≤ catenin and STAT3 pathways, and also causes the acetylation of p53. Additionally, Salmonella enterica leads to the activation of the MAPK/AKT pathway.

Aging is driven by the progressive, lifelong accumulation of unrepaired cellular damage. Such damages mainly include oxidized, aggregated, or misfolded (nonfunctional) proteins that can act as cellular toxins, thereby compromising cell function and viability. Damage can be produced by injurious exogenous and endogenous factors such as high temperatures and reactive oxygen species, or by mutations generated spontaneously (from replication error) or caused by chemical and physical mutagens. These damages are incurred at a nearly constant level in both soma and germline throughout the adult lifespan, and can be effectively repaired or eliminated at the DNA or protein level by the repair/maintenance systems, including the distinct DNA repair pathways, autophagy (the main mechanism of cellular self‚Äêdegradation), the proteasome‚Äìubiquitin system, and molecular chaperones. Occasionally, if repair/degradation fails, the compromised cell is rapidly lost via cell death, thus maintaining the integrity of the tissue. In aging somatic cells, however, in which the Piwi‚ÄêpiRNA pathway is not active, the mobilization of TEs (biological mutagens) generates additional mutations at an increasing rate throughout the adult lifespan, thereby causing severe genomic instability at advanced ages. The TE‚Äêinduced mutations remain unrepaired, and lead to further protein damages that increasingly accumulate in the cytoplasm. Under a critical threshold, TE‚Äêderived damages are also eliminated by the maintenance systems. When the level of TE‚Äêtriggered cellular damages passes this threshold, the affected cell initiates a self‚Äêkilling program. Massive levels of cell death then cause a fatal age‚Äêassociated disease, and, eventually, death. The mobilization of TEs can mutagenize genes that participate in repair and maintenance systems. For example, when a TE jumps into an autophagy‚Äêrelated gene in an individual somatic genome, the autophagic process becomes compromised in the affected cell. This mechanism can explain why the capacity of the repair and maintenance systems declines in old organisms, which further contributes to the accumulation of cellular damage in this life period. Thus, TE‚Äêcaused genomic instability predominantly contributes to the aging process. In other words, TEs may represent the primary genetic determinants of aging. Thick arrows represent significant effects, while thin ones show slight effects. Within the thick arrows at right: AAP, age‚Äêassociated pathology; D, death.",/pmc/articles/PMC5595689/figure/acel12630-fig-0002/,PMC5595689,ACEL-16-906-g002.jpg

AŒ≤ in the blood stream binds to and deforms circulating red blood cells causing impaired oxygen saturation. B) ROS present at the BBB cause astrocytes to withdraw their endfoot processes while secreting NTBI molecules and upregulating ferrous iron transporters. C) The increased influx of ferrous iron in astrocytes upregulate ferritin formation for intracellular iron storage. D) Glutathione is reduced in AD, exaggerating the effects of deleterious ROS. Activated astrocytes increase their iron load while expressing cytoplasmic APP. E) APOE secretion is elevated facilitating the sequestration of AŒ≤42 in the extracellular space. F) High extracellular iron concentration causes neurons to continually influx iron via NTBI and neuronal iron import. G) Neuronal iron export is enhanced through increased post-translational expression of APP which acts to export iron via ferroportin. H) Elevated cholesterol in the neuronal cell membrane alters secretase activity to elevate the production of AŒ≤42 production. I) Iron efflux from neuron helps seed AŒ≤42 progressing into AŒ≤ fibrils and plaques. Microglia migrate toward activated astrocytes and AŒ≤ deposits where they phagocytose AŒ≤ plaques. J) Lysosomal degradation of AŒ≤ plaques increase iron within the microglia which is in turn is incorporated into ferritin along their cytoplasmic border. Glutathione levels are decreased and the ferritin degradation and secretion pathway is impaired. Hemosiderin deposits form inside microglia further impairing their function. K) Reduction of ferritin export impairs oligodendrocytes iron uptake reducing remyelination. L) In addition, microvesicles communicated between microglia and oligodendrocytes cause myelinotoxicy and increased microglial inflammatory cytokine release. M) Demyelination sloughs off high amounts of toxic iron, lipids and cholesterol into the exoplasmic space. This process also exposes APP present in the myelin sheath, which can propagate amyloidosis. N) There is a reciprocal increase of iron proteins and ferrous iron in the CSF and a decrease of amyloid products in the CSF, which may reflect a failure of amyloid clearance out of parenchymal space.",/pmc/articles/PMC4672943/figure/F8/,PMC4672943,nihms719816f8.jpg

After its functional significance as a major suppressor of tissue growth was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster, Hippo, a downstream signal transducer (Warts) and target (Yorkie) were found to have great structural and functional conservation in mammals (, , , , ). The upstream signals that activate/inhibit this pathway are still not completely understood, but the proposed initiators include mechanical forces, cellular stress, cellular polarity, and cell-cell contact (, , , , , , , ). Upon activation of the Hippo pathway, the serine-threonine kinase cascade involving Mammalian STE20-like protein kinase (Mst1/2 kinases) phosphorylates and activates a second class of kinases, large tumor suppressor kinases (Lats1/2). The Lats1/2 kinases phosphorylate Yap; this phosphorylation sequesters Yap in the cytoplasm, which prevents nuclear translocation and instead signals its proteasomal degradation (, ). Inhibition of the Hippo pathway enables unphosphorylated Yap to translocate to, and be retained in, the nucleus (, ). Within the nucleus, due to its lack of a DNA binding domain, Yap binds to sets of transcription factors. One major family identified is the TEA domain transcription factor [Tead1‚Äì4; HGNC: 11714‚Äì11717] (, , ). Binding to Tead causes transcription of target genes responsible for cellular proliferation and inhibition of cellular apoptosis, among them cyclins, inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP), and connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) (, , ). Other transcription factors that interact with Yap/Taz are PPXY-motif containing proteins such as tumor suppressor p73, Smads, and Runx2. PPXY-motif interacts with the WW domain of Yap (, , , ). Additionally, Tbx5, which lacks a WW domain-interacting PPXY-motif, physically interacts with transcription coactivator Taz via multiple domains, including its carboxyl-terminal sequence (). The Hippo-Yap pathway, which we define in this review as Mst1/2-Lats1/2 signaling influencing Yap, also interacts with numerous other pathways, including Wnt, Bmp, TgfŒ≤, Shh, and Notch (, , , , , , , , , , , ). The diversity of these pathways highlights the impact of Yap on multiple biological processes and the complexity of its regulatory pathways. Because the role of the Hippo-Yap signaling pathway during development has been particularly well studied during embryogenesis of the mouse eye, we will briefly highlight the complex processes that occur during embryogenesis of mouse ocular tissues. Ocular development is a complex process that depends on various signaling pathways.

Each candidate transduction mechanism can be probed in turn by inhibiting it in an assay in which an induced change in transmembrane potential leads to an observable phenotype (increase in proliferation, up-regulation of a target gene, cell migration, etc.). For example, if gene X is up-regulated upon depolarization but this up-regulation does not occur in the presence of a GdCl, then voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) opening is implicated. If on the other hand a blocker of gap-junctional communication (GJC) abolishes the effects of depolarization, this suggests that the voltage-gated control of GJC and small molecule movement mediate the effects.

Maintenance of a differentiated phenotype of SMCs depends on the PI3-K/PKB(Akt) pathway. In contrast, the coordinate activation of the ERK and p38MAPK pathways induces SMC de-differentiation. IGF-I, which is a potent factor for maintaining the differentiated SMC phenotype, activates the signaling pathway mediated through PI3-K/PKB(Akt), but not MAPKs. Blocking the PI3-K/PKB(Akt) pathway with specific inhibitors of PI3-K, LY249002, or wortmannin, induces SMC de-differentiation.

Thus, PDGF-BB triggers the dual signaling pathways, PI3-K/PKB(Akt) and two MAPKs. When the ERK and p38MAPK pathways were simultaneously blocked by their specific inhibitors, PD98059 and SB203580, PDGF-BB in turn initiates to induce maintaining SMC differentiation.

(Left) Stressors activate the body‚Äôs stress response system, which is comprised of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands (i.e., HPA axis) as well as the stress hormones they produce (e.g., adrenocorticotropic hormone and glucocorticoids). Stress also activates the sympathetic nervous system, which secretes catecholamines. These hormones act on various organs and tissues that are part of the immune system. In response, immune cells secrete cytokines that via the blood are transported to the brain. There, these cytokines lead to brain neuroimmune-gene induction that sensitizes stress-response pathways. At the same time, the immune system communicates with the CNS through sensory (afferent) nerves that activate the brain in response to stressful stimuli. This communication pathway involves particularly the vagus nerve and the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brain stem. (Right) Alcohol influences neuroimmune signaling via its effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Consumed ethanol enters the stomach and gut and makes them ‚Äúleaky‚Äù by inducing the release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which in turn activates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the gut. As a result, bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can enter the blood and reach the liver. Both LPS and ethanol (which also reaches the liver via the circulation) contribute to inflammatory reactions in the liver, which lead to release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±) and other proinflammatory cytokines from the liver. These proinflammatory cytokines in the blood enter the brain and increase neuroimmune-gene expression. Chronic ethanol also increases expression of HMGB1‚ÄìTLR4 signaling in the brain, leading to persistent and progressive increases in neuroimmune-gene expression in the brain.",/pmc/articles/PMC4590627/figure/f6-arcr-37-2-331/,PMC4590627,arcr-37-2-331f6.jpg

DA binds striatal postsynaptic D1 receptors inducing the formation of cAMP, which in turn favours the activation of PKA, able to phosphorylate and activate DA- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 KDa (DARPP-32) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Once phosphorylated, DARPP-32 is able to inhibit protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1). Glutamate (blue) and BDNF (red) are released from corticostriatal terminals into the striatum. Glutamate release is regulated by endocannabinoids (eCB) activated by increases in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentrations through adenosine A2a and muscarinic M1 receptors activation, among other mechanisms, and retrogradely released by postsynaptic striatal neurons. Once released, glutamate activates metabotropic as well as NMDA and AMPA ionotropic receptors, whose activity and surface expression at postsynaptic membrane is also regulated by D1 receptors. In serotoninergic afferents, 5-hydroxytryptophan is converted to serotonin (5-HT) (green) by Aromatic-L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) and released into the striatum. Cholinergic and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-positive interneurons cooperate to induction of corticostriatal LTP and LTD. (b) In dyskinetic state L-DOPA is converted to DA by AADC and released from serotoninergic terminals in unregulated manner. Higher levels of striatal BDNF may support morphological changes in serotoninergic neurons. Excess of DA abnormally stimulates D1 pathway with hyperphosphorylation of ERK and uncontrolled activation of PKA that results in hyperphosphorylation of DARPP32, which persistently blocks PP-1 causing loss of synaptic depotentiation. Abnormal D1 receptor stimulation is associated to increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and dysregulation of NMDAR subunit composition with reduction of NR2B-containing NMDAR at synaptic sites, leading to increase in NR2A/NR2B ratio that has been suggested to have a role in the loss of depotentiation. Hyperactivation of ERK through convergent altered signalling pathways brings to increased inhibition of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1/2, and consequent disinhibition of Rheb/Rhes, leading to excessive increase of signalling of mTORC1 that, in turn, exerts its long term effects through changes in protein synthesis. After chronic L-DOPA, cholinergic interneurons show increased phospho-ERK immunoreactivity and higher firing rates with increased release of acetylcholine (Ach). Striatal cGMP signalling is decreased and corticostriatal LTD, which strictly relies on the nitric-oxide- (NO-) dependent activation of protein kinase G (PKG) is abolished in dyskinetic state.",/pmc/articles/PMC3359773/figure/fig1/,PMC3359773,PD2012-358176.001.jpg

(A) At abnormally high calcium (Ca2+) influx rates, such as during elevated glutamate signaling, calcineurin (CaN) becomes highly active and triggers the pathway of apoptosis by dephosphorylating the pro-apoptotic factor Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) which translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and dimerizes with the anti-apoptotic factors B-cell lymphphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). The event spurs another pro-apoptotic factor, Bcl-2-associated-X (BAX), to transition to the OMM and catalyze the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). The sustained high Ca2+ load continues to maintain the opening of the mPTP, leading to the release of cytochrome c and formation of the apoptosome, culminating in the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis. (B) CaN has also shown to be involved in triggering mitochondrial fission by dephosphorylating the dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). DRP1 translocates to the OMM, forms puncta, and constricts the mitochondria with an oligomeric chain and splices the organelle similar to vesicular cleavage by dynamin. The fission of mitochondria is thought to come before the release of cytochrome c, leading to dysfunction and triggering apoptosis or necrosis based on the rate and severity of the event. Evidence has shown that mitochondrial fission is indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction, and the spherical mitochondrial debris void of cytochrome c implicates the occurrence of cell death pathways.",/pmc/articles/PMC6062828/figure/fig4/,PMC6062828,oc-2018-00230d_0004.jpg

Annu Rev Biochem. ;81:767-793.",,IRE1Œ±- and PERK-mediated cell death pathways,Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Type 2 Diabetes.,"IRE1Œ±- and PERK-mediated cell death pathways. During endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inositol-requiring protein 1Œ± (IRE1Œ±) forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) () and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) () and then recruits the protein kinase JNK, leading to the activation of JNK (). The IRE1Œ±-TRAF2 complex recruits IŒ∫B kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates inhibitor of Œ∫B (IŒ∫B), leading to the degradation of IŒ∫B and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor Œ∫-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-Œ∫B) (). IRE1Œ± also modulates the activation of other ‚Äúalarm genes,‚Äù such as p38 and ERK (), possibly by the binding of the Src homology (SH) 2/3 -containing adaptor proteins Nck and TRAF2, respectively. Furthermore, several proapoptotic (i.e., BAX/BAK, AIP1, and maybe PTP-1B) or antiapoptotic proteins (i.e., BI-1) interact with IRE1Œ±, regulating its activation state (‚Äì). Thus, the formation of a macromolecular signaling complex of IRE1Œ± with several proapoptotic proteins can generate apoptotic signals and establish an apoptotic environment. In addition, the endoribonuclease activity of IRE1Œ±, aside from specific cleavage of Xbp1 mRNA, degrades ER-targeted mRNAs that can decrease cellular functions, such as proinsulin synthesis in Œ≤-cells. In contrast to the adaptive response by the PERK-phosphorylated eIF2Œ±-ATF4 pathway, this pathway also contributes to stress-induced cell death by ATF4-mediated induction of proapoptotic genes, including CHOP, ATF3, and GADD34 (). The induced transcription factor CHOP contributes to increased expression of the proapoptotic factors, such as death receptor 5 (DR5) (), tribbles-related protein 3 (Trb3) (), and binding to microtubule (Bim) (), and it can suppress B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) expression. Bim is also activated through protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation, which prevents its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (). PERK-mediated translational attenuation upregulates NF-Œ∫B-dependent transcription because IŒ∫B has a shorter half-life than NF-Œ∫B, so NF-Œ∫B is released to translocate to the nucleus (). Recovery from translational repression is mediated by eIF2Œ± dephosphorylation by the two regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), GADD34 and CReP (constitutive repressor of eIF2Œ± phosphorylation) (). GADD34 is induced transcriptionally during ER stress by ATF4, whereas CreP is a constitutive activator of PP1. The premature dephosphorylation of eIF2Œ± by the GADD34-PP1 complex restores translation of general mRNAs, which may be detrimental if the ER protein-folding defect is not resolved.",/pmc/articles/PMC3684428/figure/F2/,PMC3684428,nihms459339f2.jpg

Preclinical data suggest that ketamine and other rapid-acting antidepressants potentiate excitatory synapses in mood-relevant brain regions, potentially reversing disease-induced deficits. New treatments may potentiate these connections while leaving synapses primarily involved in other brain functions unaltered. (a) The principle ketamine metabolic pathway occurs in the liver, resulting first in demethylation of ketamine to norketamine, followed by metabolism to the HNKs. The most prominent HNK metabolites are (2R,6R)- and (2S,6S)-HNK. (b) Rapid-acting antidepressants potentiate glutamatergic synapses. Ketamine, acting as an NMDAR antagonist, may act by preferentially blocking NMDARs localized to GABAergic interneurons, resulting in disinhibition of glutamatergic neurons and an increase in these neurons‚Äô evoked release of glutamate. Ketamine may also act by inhibiting synaptic NMDARs that are activated by spontaneously released glutamate or via inhibition of extrasynaptic NMDARs. Alternatively (or in addition), ketamine conversion to (2R,6R; 2S,6S)-HNK may result in actions on glutamatergic neurons to promote glutamate release and AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated excitation. All hypotheses converge on synaptic processes that strengthen excitatory synapses, activate cellular plasticity cascades, increase activity of AMPARs, and increase connectivity within circuits previously weakened by the pathophysiology underlying depression. Alternative approaches that may have the same net effect include inhibition of GABAŒ±5Rs, resulting in disinhibition of glutamatergic neurons; inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (not shown), resulting in inhibition of GABAergic neurons and disinhibition of glutamatergic neurons; inhibition of mGluR2s, resulting in increased probability of glutamate release; and direct activation of synaptic AMPARs and NMDARs (via AMPAkines or NMDAR modulators such as GLYX-13).

Focus on the HPA Axis and Its Promising Therapeutic Targets.,"Mechanisms linking HPA axis dysregulation and AD. Following acute stress (A), hypothalamic PVN releases CRH and AVP in the blood portal of median eminence. In response to CRH and AVP, corticotropic cells of anterior pituitary release ACTH in the peripheral circulation to induce GC secretion in blood by adrenal cortex. Succinctly, (1) GC mobilize energy resources and increase cardiovascular function to fight stress. Besides, GC inhibit unnecessary functions in the early phase of stress response, such as immunity, growth, digestion and reproduction. Then, (2) to avoid runaway of the system, GC exert an inhibitory feedback at all stages of HPA axis (hypothalamus and pituitary). In addition, as they easily penetrate in the brain, GC also act on several regions involved in the control of HPA axis activity, such as hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (tonic inhibition) or amygdala (tonic stimulation, Canet et al., ). However, chronic stress leads to a sustained activation of HPA axis and could induce stress-related disorders, as for instance MMD and AD (B, Canet et al., ). In this context, GC over-secretion is associated with GC resistance and GR signaling impairment (Chrousos et al., ). Homeostasis maintenance is compromised, leading to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, hypertension and a massive peripheral inflammation (Vitellius et al., ; Maslov et al., ). In limbic structures (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex), it was shown that GC overexposure induces hippocampal and cortical atrophy (McEwen, ) and amygdala hypertrophy (Vyas et al., , ), that could be related to learning and memory deficits, emotional impairment, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress (Sapolsky, ; McEwen, ; Bengoetxea et al., ). In the AD context, high levels of GC, and the dysregulation of the HPA axis activity observed in patients (Hartmann et al., ; Swanwick et al., ), seems to be particularly involved in the induction of amyloidogenic pathway and the abnormal phosphorylation of Tau (Green et al., ; Pineau et al., ; Sotiropoulos and Sousa, ; Vyas et al., ; Canet et al., ). Thus, it appears that the rise of circulating GC increases AD pathology, resulting in a vicious cycle by which pathology induces HPA axis dysregulation, GC overexposure and GR signaling impairment, which in turn potentiates the pathology. Due to its primordial role in the maintenance of homeostasis, targeting HPA axis offers multiple angles of action to break this vicious cycle and pave the way to new therapeutic strategies (C).

MTX is transported into the cell via the solute carrier family 19, member 1 (SLC19A1). It can be actively transported out of the cell by the ATP-binding cassette transporters including ATP-binding cassette, subfamily C (CFTR/MRP), member 1‚Äì4 (ABCC1-C4) and ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 2 (ABCG2). Within the cell it undergoes polyglutamation (activation) under the enzymic control of folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). This is a dynamic process where glutamate residues can be removed by gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH). In the polyglutamated form MTX inhibits aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC), which probably accounts for some of its anti-inflammatory effects via an intracellular rise in adenosine. Inhibition of the folate pathway may not be as important to its mechanism of action in psoriasis, but this pathway includes the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) which has been subject to a number of MTX pharmacogenetic studies in the past. MTHFR catalyses the conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate 5,10-CH2-THF to 5-methyltetrahydofolate (5-CH3-THF), which is a cosubstrate for homocysteine remethylation. The polyglutamated form of MTX also inhibits thymidylate synthase (TYMS), which converts deoxyuridylate (dUMP) to deoxythymidylate (dTMP) in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway.

In the liver, TAG is either deposited in intracellular vacuoles or exported in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles. LPA and PA require translocation through the cytosol for TAG synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum if they are not synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. DAG can be hydrolyzed to monoacylglycerol (MAG) by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and subsequently to glycerol by monoglyceride lipase (MGL). These reactions release fatty acids. Glycerol can be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. The conversion from TAG to DAG is mediated by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58) is an activator of ATGL. DAG activate PKCŒµ membrane translocation to inhibit the insulin receptor kinase. Phospholipase C can release DAG from membrane lipids. Whether DAG derived from the phospholipase C pathway and from lipid droplets can lead to PKCŒµ activation and hepatic insulin resistance remains to be determined.",/pmc/articles/PMC3353749/figure/F3/,PMC3353749,nihms363463f3.jpg

Innate immune pathways activated in sJIA are normally triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by TLRs expressed on innate immune cells, but can also be triggered by endogenous ligands in inflammatory conditions. These intracellular pathways lead to activation of the transcription factor NFŒ∫B, which is translocated into the nucleus where it upregulates expression of genes encoding several proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines initiate the inflammatory cascade through their effects on the hypothalamus, bone marrow, liver and vascular endothelial cells. Activated vascular endothelial cells act as a procoagulant surface and are likely to contribute to the coagulopathy of sJIA.107 Antibodies against endothelial cells reportedly occur in sJIA,108 although the relevance of this latter finding is unclear. The cytokines also drive joint inflammation, by stimulating osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, osteoblast apoptosis, inhibition of chondrocyte proteoglycan synthesis and synoviocyte secretion of enzymes that degrade matrix and cartilage. Since signaling through IL-1R and IL-18R shares the downstream portion of the TLR4 signaling pathway, IL-1 and IL-18 provide positive feedback loops that further contribute to perpetuation of the inflammatory responses in sJIA.

This binding releases its intracellular domain (NOTCH-ICD) that enters into nucleus to modify target gene expression (such as SOX9, HEY, and HES).

Although work is at an early stage, several lines of evidence already suggest that CLCA proteins (particularly hCLCA1) may be master regulators of mucin gene expression in humans. We have gradually developed the proposal that the airway maintains a special program for host defense and that changes in this same program may lead to airway disease. The same argument can be made for mucus secretion. Thus, under normal circumstances a physiologic level of mucus production allows for mucociliary clearance of particulate matter from the airway and aids in defense against respiratory pathogens. However, if mucus secretion is excessive, it leads to airway obstruction and consequent dysfunction. In both normal and abnormal conditions, there appears to be an immune axis that drives cytokine production, and in turn, a downstream mechanism that translates the cytokine signal into mucin gene expression. In humans, this downstream mechanism features hCLCA1, the first member of a newly defined family of ‚Äúchloride channel calcium-activated‚Äù (CLCA) proteins in humans. It is possible that additional CLCA family members may mediate airway hyperreactivity, but this issue requires further study. In either case, the mechanism for how hCLCA1 might signal to cause mucin gene expression and mucous cell metaplasia is a goal of ongoing studies. Initial analysis of CLCA structure and function suggests that these proteins are secreted and cleaved into fragment polypeptides. We are particularly focused on defining the possibility that hCLCA1 is a secreted protein that is cleaved into an active polypeptide that in turn binds to a receptor on the cell surface and signals to activate mucin gene expression (). This scheme for hCLCA1 (and orthologous mClca3,5,6) control over epithelial behavior can be tested in isolated airway epithelial cells as well as mouse models and then in patients with mucous cell metaplasia due to asthma or COPD or other inflammatory airway diseases. A full understanding of this pathway will eventually provide multiple targets for therapeutic intervention, including modifications of hCLCA1 expression, processing, and signaling. A particular challenge for therapeutic strategies will be to block excessive mucus prduction without compromising host defense and thereby restore proper balance to the mucociliary system.",/pmc/articles/PMC4017675/figure/F5/,PMC4017675,nihms574943f5.jpg

Trends Cell Biol. ;26(4):300-312.",,,Probing the complexities of astrocyte calcium signaling.,"The cartoon shows various sources and sinks for Ca2+ in cells. In going forward, these need to be considered carefully in studies of astrocytes. Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ are dynamically regulated through interplay between Ca2+ channels, pumps and transporters. A variety of Ca2+ channels exist which are expressed on both the plasma membrane and the membrane of organelles. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are highly selective plasma membrane proteins that mediate Ca2+ signals in excitable cells in response to membrane depolarization. A number of neurotransmitters mediate Ca2+ signals through less-selective ligand-gated ion channels. These include cell surface P2X receptors activated by ATP and the NMDA class of ionotropic receptors for glutamate (NMDAR). Nicotinic acetylcholine (AChR) and 5-HT3 (5HT3R) receptors are Ca2+-permeable members of the cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels activated by acetylcholine and 5-HT, respectively. TRP channels constitute a large family of widely expressed ion channels. They are divided into 6 families in mammals. Their Ca2+ selectivity varies widely and they are activated by a number of intracellular and extracellular cues including heat (e.g. TRPV1), cold (e.g. TRPM8), pungent chemicals (TRPA) and Ca2+ itself (TRPP2). TRPC channels are activated upon receptor-mediated signaling downstream of phospholipase C signaling via diacylglycerol in some cases. Orai channels are highly Ca2+-selective channels activated by the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM upon depletion of ER Ca2+ stores. Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) pumps and sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX) transport Ca2+ out of the cytosol. IP3 receptors are intracellular Ca2+-permeable channels localized predominately to the ER where they mediate Ca2+ signals in response to IP3 produced upon phospholipase C activation, which occurs downstream of GPCR activation. Receptor stimulation also elevates levels of, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) which activates the related ryanodine receptors (RyR). The ER Ca2+ stores are filled by sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA The Golgi complex (not shown) also acts as a dynamic Ca2+ store housing IP3 and ryanodine receptors for Ca2+ release and secretory pathway ATPases (together with SERCA) for filling. In addition to the ER, a number of acidic organelles which include lysosomes also serve as Ca2+ stores. These acidic Ca2+ stores express two-pore channels (TPCs), activated by the intracellular messenger NAADP, and TRPM2 activated by ADP-ribose (which additionally activates plasma membrane TRPM2). TRP mucolipins (TRPML) and P2X4 receptors are also expressed on lysosomes. Ca2+ is also dynamically regulated by mitochondria. Ca2+ is rapidly taken up by the mitochondrial uniporter (MCU) which is a Ca2+-permeable channel localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Ca2+ is slowly released back into the cytosol by the actions of a mitochondrially targeted sodium-calcium changer (NCLX). The Ca2+ concentrations for the intracellular compartments were taken from published work [-].",/pmc/articles/PMC4946798/figure/F2/,PMC4946798,nihms754327f2.jpg

Extracellular Ca2+ can enter the cell via the TRPM2 channel, where it activates CaMKII that phosphorylates Beclin 1, promoting its binding to Bcl-2 and blocking autophagy initiation. Beclin 1 can also be scaffolded to the IP3R, which also limits autophagy promotion. IP3Rs are responsible for fueling mitochondria with Ca2+, which supports the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the resulting ATP production. The presence of an adequate ATP/AMP ratio suppresses the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)‚Äìmechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)‚Äìunc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) axis and thus autophagy induction. Autophagosome maturation can be inhibited by the TRPML3 channel mostly expressed in endosomes, while fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes can be blocked by basal RyR activity. Ca2+ release through lysosomal nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-activated TPC2 channels can be further amplified by Ca2+ release from IP3Rs resulting in stimulation of the CaMKKŒ≤‚ÄìAMPK pathway and autophagosome formation. Ca2+ release from the lysosomes can, however, affect lysosomal pH and so abrogate fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes as well as the further lysosome-dependent degradation. TRPML1, another lysosomal channel, can be regulated by different factors, including lysosomal mTOR, PI(3,5)P2 or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ca2+ released from TRPML1 activates calcineurin, which binds and dephosphorylates TFEB and promotes its nuclear translocation, where TFEB induces transcription of various autophagy-related and lysosomal biogenesis genes.

Alternatively, cadherins may be endocytosed. They then can either be trafficked back to the cell surface (via a post-Golgi recycling pathway) or ultimately targeted for degradation, at least in part via lysosomes. Cadherins delivered to the cell surface can thus derive either from newly synthesized material or via the recycling pathway. p120 appears to play a key gatekeeper function in determining the fate of cadherins after delivery to the surface.

A. Ligand activation of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) leads to activation of the stimulatory G protein (Gs) and its Œ±-subunit; this is followed by activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC). AC converts ATP into cAMP. In the basal state, PKA consists of two regulatory subunits (R) bound to two catalytic subunits (C). cAMP-binding to R causes dissociation from C, which is now free to act as a serine/threonine kinase. It can activate cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) by phosphorylation, which mediates transcription of genes with cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-containing promoters. The PKA pathway contributes to the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, metabolism and hormone secretion. The phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyse cAMP, thereby reducing PKA pathway activity. B. In Carney complex, R1Œ± levels are reduced, leading to increased PKA activation, reduced transforming growth factor Œ≤ (TGFŒ≤)-mediated apoptosis, increased mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent proliferation and a stimulated Wnt signalling pathway.",/pmc/articles/PMC149053/figure/fig7/,PMC4497946,nihms654341f2a.jpg

Curr Opin Cell Biol. ;22(2):226-233.",,,Autophagy Genes as Tumor Suppressors.,"The induction of autophagy by various stimuli (e.g. starvation, hypoxia, etc) signals through the activation of the TSC1/TSC2 complex that leads to the inhibition of mTOR. Dephosphorylated mAtg13 resulting from mTOR inactivation then associates with and activates the Atg1/ULK kinase. Together, they form the Atg1 kinase complex with FIP200 and Atg101, triggering the autophagic cascade. Vesicle nucleation is primarily driven by the class III phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase (PI3KC3) complex. The core subunits of this complex include PI3KC3, p150, and Beclin1. Recent data suggest that mulitple Beclin1 complexes may be involved in the mammalian autophagy regulation. In pariticular, the tumor suppressor, UVRAG, Bif-1 (an UVRAG interactor), and probably Ambra-1 associate with Beclin1 to activate autophagy. This is frequently dysregulated in many human cancers. Additionally, Atg14 was also found to promote atuophagy by forming a separate complex with Beclin1. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins negatively regulate autophagy by sequestering Beclin1. This is counteracted by the proapoptotic BH3-only molecules which promote autophagy by freeing Beclin1 from Bcl-2 inhibition. Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are involved in autophagosomal membrane expansion and completion: one is the Atg8/LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugation, the other is the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 conjugation. After proteolytic cleavage of its carboxyterminus by the Atg4C cystein protease, Atg8 is coupled to the membrane lipid PE after sequential processing by Atg7, an E1-like enzyme and Atg3, an E2-like enzyme. Atg12 is conjugated to Atg5 in a similar manner except Atg10 is used as the E2 enzyme instead of Atg3. During this conjugation process, the interation of ubiquitin-like Atg8 with Atg3 can be severely disturbed by FLIP, an oncogenic protein. In contrast, proapoptotic DAPK positively regulates this process by associating with an Atg8/LC3-interacting cytoskeleton molecule, MAP1B. The fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome signifies the maturation stage of the autophagy pathway, a step that is least understood but has been found to functionally converge with the endocytic pathway. Lysosomal fusion is driven by SNAREs, the small GTPase Rab7, PI3KC3, and the HOPS complex which consists of the class C vacuolar protein sorting (C/Vps) complex core (Vps11, Vps16, Vps18, and Vps33) and two additional subunits Vps39 and Vps41 [‚Äì]. UVRAG forms a complex with HOPS and facilitates HOPS-mediated membrane tethering, which likely involves Rab7 activation. In addition, Rubicon was recently found to associate with the endosome-associated PI3KC3 complex, exerting an inhibitory effect on the PI3KC3 activity and the fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome. Not only are effector proteins of autophagy implicated in cancer development, but the autophagy pathway is also regulated by both oncogenes and tumor suppressors.",/pmc/articles/PMC2854193/figure/F1/,PMC2854193,nihms159173f1.jpg

Top: In the bone marrow, only small populations (~10%) of the newly generated B cells bearing monomeric IgM (Y shape with IgŒ±/Ig√ü, two purple lines carrying green ITAM) on the plasma membrane (PM) are survived by ligand-independent (or tonic) signals through activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and suppression of the FOXO1-mediated Rag1/2 activity (left). By contrast, ~90% of the newly generated immature B cells have variable binding affinities for autoantigens (green leaf shape) and are subjected to negative selection by receptor editing or apoptosis (right). Autoantigens opsonized with natural pentameric IgM (broom shape) simultaneously bind the corresponding BCR and FcŒºR (blue tennis racket shape with three conserved Tyr residues in yellow). The resultant cross-linkage of BCR and FcŒºR on immature autoreactive B cells may inhibit the BCR-mediated PI3K-AKT pathway, resulting in relief of the AKT-mediated suppression of FOXO1 and leading to activation of Rag1/2 and receptor editing, thereby contributing to negative selection or central tolerance. In the absence of FcŒºR autoantibodies against dsDNA or chromatin are increased. Bottom: In peripheral lymphoid tissues, incompletely edited B cells express IgM BCR with self-reactivity to membrane components (brown triangles) present on ER membranes, but no interaction of monomeric IgM with the corresponding antigens occurs due to its low affinity. When cells receive signals from TLR, a switch from Œºm to Œºs exon usage occurs along with the synthesis of J chain during the translocation from ER to the ER Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or the Golgi and the resultant pentameric IgM is contained inside the vesicles where it binds membrane components via the Fab regions and its Fc portion binds FcŒºR. This cis engagement of self-antigen/secreted IgM/FcŒºR within the vesicles prevents further development of such autoreactive B cells, thereby contributing to peripheral tolerance.

In the brain, glutamate can either be synthesized de novo from glucose via the Krebs cycle and the transamination of Œ±-oxoglutatrate or it can be recycled through the Glu/Gln cycle (see above). Glutamate is transported into synaptic vesicles by vesicular Glu transporters.

There are three excitatory ionotropic receptors identified by their pharmacological properties as AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors. Metabotropic glutamate receptors couple to different signal transduction systems and ligand sensitivities. Glutamate is cleared from the extracellular space via high-affinity excitatory amino acid transporters in neighboring glial cells, which convert Glu into Gln via the action of glutamine synthetase.

The ternary complex also enhances cell proliferation by inducing the activation of the Ras-mediated signalling pathway through inhibiting Necl-5-associated sprouty2 (Spry2). At this stage, nectins and cadherins are sparsely distributed on the cell surface. (B) The initial cell‚Äìcell contact is formed by the trans-interaction of nectin-3 with Necl-5. At this stage, the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton starts with the activation of Cdc42 and Rac. (C) The trans-interaction of nectin-3 with Necl-5 is transient, and Necl-5 is subsequently downregulated from the cell surface by endocytosis. Next, trans-interaction of nectins occurs. (D) Cadherins are recruited to nectin-based cell‚Äìcell adhesion sites and homophilically interact in trans to form adherens junctions (AJs). At this stage, integrin Œ±vŒ≤3 becomes inactive by the action of trans-interacting nectins. Due to the downregulation of Necl-5 from the cell surface, Spry2 is released from Necl-5 and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src and becomes active to inhibit the Ras-mediated cell proliferation signals. The intracellular signalling mediated by integrin Œ±vŒ≤3 and PDGF receptor is then suppressed, resulting in the inhibition of cell movement and proliferation (contact inhibition).",/pmc/articles/PMC3081173/figure/fig04/,PMC3081173,pjab-86-621-g004.jpg

There have been three major families of growth factors that have been identified as being important regulators of cardiac development: the transforming growth factor beta-family (TGFŒ≤) such as BMPs and Activin (), the Wnt family, and the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family [‚Äì]. While these pathways are able to be distinguished from each other, there may be a cooperative interplay between these developmental pathways []. It is becoming evident that there is a temporal and spatial segregation of molecular signals that are required to create the correct environment for cardiac differentiation. The TGFŒ≤, Wnt and FGF families all play an important role on differentiation to any lineage, but are especially important for mesoderm formation. These signals must be delivered at appropriate combinations and timing, and subsequently turned off at the appropriate time to allow for specific differentiation. Addition of BMP4 during embryoid body differentiation was found to induce the development of mesoderm, or Brachyury (T) positive tissue. However, the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signals play a biphasic role in mouse ES differentiation, as these signals must then be inhibited to promote precardiac progenitor formation []. If the signaling is not removed, the cells will instead form Flk-1+ mesoderm that moves toward a hemangioblast lineage []. Using Nodal, or adding Activin A to act as a surrogate for Nodal, enhanced mesendoderm formation, but a careful balance must be achieved, as higher concentrations of Activin A promoted formation of endoderm over mesoderm []. The subsequent addition of BMP 4, in addition to Activin A, is thought to further commit the cells down a cardiac lineage, and generate cardiomoycytes [, ]. However, BMPs have also exhibited biphasic activity and must be expressed and inhibited at appropriate intervals []. For example, the endogenous BMP inhibitor Noggin, when in use with mESCs, has been seen to increase cardiomyogenesis. Similarly, when a BMP small molecule inhibitor was used within the first 24 hours of culture, it robustly increased cardiomyogenesis and reduced differentiation into endothelial and smooth muscle lineages []. Conversely, this BMP inhibition must be removed in later differentiation steps as BMPs have also been shown to upregulate SMAD signaling and MAP3K7 signaling for proper heart development [, ]. The role of FGF, however, is less defined. While studies have suggested a synergistic partnership between members of the FGF and BMP families to promote heart induction during development, the precise pathway and interaction remains unclear [, ].",/pmc/articles/PMC3282989/figure/F2/,PMC3282989,nihms355051f2.jpg

The prototypical activation of ERK cascade is initiated at the plasmamembrane by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in response to growth factors. Activated RTKs promote RAS stimulation through recruitment of SOS exchange factor. RAS facilitates the activation of MEK-ERK cascade through serial phosphorylation. Once activated, ERK translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates transcription factors, modulating the transcription of hundreds of genes. In cardiac myocytes under stress (aortic stenosis and hypertension), ERK is activated in response to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and/or ‚Äústretch-sensitive‚Äù sensors, such as membrane bound integrins, and the sarcomere. The activation of ERK cascade is regulated by scaffold proteins (KSR, Shoc2, Erbin, Œ≤-arrestin, IQGAP, Melusin, FHL1, and ANKRD1), which bind components of the RAF-MEK-ERK module, facilitating their functional interaction and subcellular localization. Scaffolds also link the ERK activation to specific upstream signal and affect the duration of the signal.",/pmc/articles/PMC6539093/figure/ijms-20-02164-f002/,PMC6539093,ijms-20-02164-g002.jpg

Environmental triggers (e.g. drugs, infections, physical and psychological trauma) cause predisposed individuals to develop an autoimmune reaction, although the exact initiation mechanism is still poorly understood. One explanatory model  suggests that the autoantigen is LL37 (cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, encoded by CAMP), which complexes with DNA and RNA released from stressed keratinocytes. This induces plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce IFN‚ÄêŒ±, which activates dermal dendritic cells (DCs). These cells migrate to skin‚Äêdraining lymph nodes, where they secrete IL‚Äê12 and IL‚Äê23, hereby stimulating na√Øve T‚Äêcells to differentiate into Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells. The Th cells are attracted into the dermis by chemokines (CCL20, CCL17, CCL27, CXCL9/10/11) released by keratinocytes. Th1 cells produce IFN‚ÄêŒ≥ and TNF‚ÄêŒ±, while Th17 cells release IL‚Äê22 and IL‚Äê17 family cytokines. The latter (IL‚Äê17A/F) trigger epidermal keratinocytes to a feed‚Äêforward inflammatory response , inducing numerous psoriasis‚Äêassociated genes [defensins, S100 proteins, chemokines; keratinocytes also produce IL‚Äê17 cytokines, shown is a putative, autocrine IL‚Äê17C loop ] and stimulating keratinocyte proliferation. The released chemokines CXCL1/2/3/5/8 recruit neutrophils (N), which generate ROS (reactive oxygen species), Œ±‚Äêdefensin (DEFA1), CXCL8, CCL20, and IL‚Äê6. IL‚Äê23 (released by activated DCs) stimulates differentiation and expansion of Th22 cells, which secrete IL‚Äê22 that induces STAT3 and KRT16 expression. This causes further epidermal hyperplasia and eventually formation of the psoriatic plaque. To the right (punctuated arrows) is shown the IL‚Äê36/IL‚Äê1 pathway prevalent in pustular psoriasis, which is characterized by accumulation of neutrophils; here, IL‚Äê17 activated neutrophils trigger increased IL‚Äê36 activity, which stimulates DC's to produce IL‚Äê1Œ≤ reinforcing the Th17 axis .

S-adenosyl methionine (S-AdoMet) is synthesized from methionine by the SAM synthetase, it is then converted to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by the ACC synthase (ACS), 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) being a by-product. MTA is recycled to methionine through the Yang Cycle by successive enzymatic reactions involving different intermediates among which 5-methylthioribose (MTR) and 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (KMB). S-AdoMet is also the precursor of the spermidine/spermine biosynthesis pathway. Ethylene production results from the ACC oxidation catalyzed by the ACC oxidase (ACO) that also generates carbon dioxide and cyanide. Malonylation of ACC to malonyl-ACC (MACC) reduces ACC content and consequently ethylene production. Ethylene can stimulate its own biosynthesis, by improving ACC synthesis catalyzed by ACS, and conversion to ethylene by ACO. Ethylene binds to receptors (among which ethylene receptor 1, ETR1) located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which leads to the deactivation of the receptors that become able to recruit CTR1 (constitutive triple response). Release of CTR1 inhibition allows EIN2 to act as a positive regulator of ethylene signaling pathway. EIN2 acts upstream of nuclear transcription factors, such as EIN3 (ethylene insensitive), EILs (EIN3-like), ERBPs (ethylene responsive element binding protein), and ERFs (ethylene response factor). ‚Üí and ‚Äî‚àô arrows indicate positive and negative interactions between the different elements of the signaling cascade, respectively.",/pmc/articles/PMC4193209/figure/F1/,PMC4193209,fpls-05-00539-g001.jpg

TGFŒ≤ elevates activity of three cyclin-dependent kinase‚Äôs inhibitor: p15, p21 and p27. p15, p21 and p27 inhibit the complex formation between cyclinD and CDK4,6 and p27, p21 further prevent cyclinE-CDK2‚Äôs activation. TGFŒ≤ elevates expression of CDK4/6-specific inhibitor p15. p27 binds to CDK4,6 to form a complex, meanwhile, p27 is released from this protein complex under the presence of p15. p15 indirectly stimulates the surge of p27. CyclinD1 and CDKs 4,6 form a complex which drives the cell proliferation in combination with complex formed by cyclinE and CDK2. Besides TGFŒ≤ pathway, hyperactive Ras signaling regulates cell developments and promotes cell growth. (a) Dynamic Bayesian Network.

Protein kinase A (PKA) signalling is required for iron limitation-induced, hypoxia and lactate-induced Œ≤-glucan masking (Fig.¬†). However, masking in response to iron limitation is not dependent upon adenylyl cyclase (Fig.¬†), unlike lactate-induced (Fig.¬†) or hypoxia-induced Œ≤-glucan masking. Regarding the upstream signalling modules, iron limitation activates Œ≤-glucan masking via the iron transceptor Ftr1 and the iron responsive transcription factor Sfe1. In contrast, lactate triggers Œ≤-glucan masking via the receptor, Gpr1 (ref. ) and the hypoxia signal appears to be transduced via mitochondrial ROS signalling. Hypoxia-induced mitochondrial ROS signalling seems to lie upstream of PKA signalling. In contrast, iron-related Ftr1-Sef1 signalling appears to act independently of PKA signalling (Fig.¬†). Since PKA signalling is not required for cell wall elaboration or growth under iron-limiting conditions (Fig.¬†) this pathway might promote Œ≤-glucan masking via cell wall remodelling mechanisms that remain to be defined. Ftr1-Sef1 signalling is required for cell wall elaboration and growth under iron limitation (Fig.¬†) and therefore might promote Œ≤-glucan masking by driving the synthesis of a relatively thick outer mannan layer (Figs.¬†, ).

Unphosphorylated dynein (Dyn) may be bound to Ndel1 (yellow triangle) and actively translocating (arrow). (B) Insulin (dark orange circle) binds to receptors, activating a signaling pathway that locally and transiently inactivates GSK-3Œ≤ by S9 phosphorylation. Dynein becomes locally and transiently dephosphorylated, is released from APC, binds to Ndel1, and then moves toward MT minus ends. The increase in number of processive dyneins results in minus-end accumulation at centrosomes (not shown). (C) MIN cells in the absence of insulin or serum factors: GSK-3Œ≤ is active, but there is a reduced pool of dynein associated with FL-APC because MIN APC blocks the interaction.

In the classical signaling pathway (right) the steroid hormone binds to its receptor located in the cytoplasm; the activated receptor dimerizes and makes its way into the nucleus where it interacts with responsive elements to activate or inhibit gene transcription. Also steroid hormones can bind to mitochondrial receptors that regulate mitochondrial DNA transcription. In the non-classical pathway (left) steroid hormones act through membrane receptors, including the classical receptors, GPCR receptors, ionotropic receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and other neurotransmitter receptors. This non-classical pathway initiates cytosolic signaling cascades, modulating the activation of various proteins and of second messenger systems. Additionally, progesterone and its metabolites promote myelination and remyelination at the oligodendrocyte level in the CNS and that of Schwann cells in the PNS.",/pmc/articles/PMC5974145/figure/F2/,PMC5974145,fpubh-06-00141-g0002.jpg

Saturated FFA could stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production in chondrocytes directly through TLR4.

Consequently, the levels of circulatory lactate are also increased in response to HFD treatment. The increased lactate would stabilize and activate HIF-1Œ± protein in chondrocytes to stimulate the production of VEGF and proinflammatory cytokines. In summary, saturated FFA could stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production in chondrocytes directly through TLR4 or LDHa-lactate-HIF1Œ± pathway, which provides a potential molecular mechanism linking obesity to chronic inflammation in osteoarthritis.",/pmc/articles/PMC4536527/figure/f8/,PMC4536527,srep13092-f8.jpg

KCa3.1 is a six transmembrane domain K+ channel in which the N- and C-termini are cytoplasmic. The lysine within the BLAP sequence is specifically labeled with biotin via the co-expressed BirA-KDEL in the endoplasmic reticulum. Plasma membrane-expressed channels are then specifically labeled with streptavidin‚ÄìAlexa555 such that only plasma membrane localized channels are tagged with fluorophore. (B) The labeling of KCa3.1 and the plasma membrane with unique fluorophores. Following labeling of plasma membrane channels with streptavidin‚ÄìAlexa555 (red) and the plasma membrane itself with WGA‚ÄìAlexa488 (green) we can discriminate between plasma membrane-localized KCa3.1 and channels in either endosomes or lysosomes, as illustrated. Channels within the biosynthetic pathway are biotinylated, but not fluorescently tagged (shown in blue), and therefore not recognized in this assay. High-resolution images of individual cells are shown to further illustrate this protocol. As shown at time 0, KCa3.1 is localized exclusively to the plasma membrane. This colocalization is shown as yellow. By contrast, after 90 min at 37¬∞C, KCa3.1 has been endocytosed (red endosomes). By examining the loss of colocalization we can determine the amount of endocytosis and whether this is affected by small molecules.

A new schema of hemodynamic regulation suggests actions of Ang II to stimulate FGF-23 in bone (afferent limb), leading to additive renal effects with Ang II (efferent limb) to increase blood pressure and cardiomegaly. In this model, FGF-23 effects are mediated by activation of FGFR/Œ±-Klotho complexes, whereas Ang II activates AT1 receptors in renal tubules to enhance sodium transport, and to suppress Œ±-Klotho. The resulting positive sodium balance leads to increased blood pressure and the reduced levels of soluble Klotho (s-Kl) may enhance cardiotoxicity through s-Kl-dependent TRPC6 cardiac effects. In contrast, FGF-23 suppresses, whereas Ang II stimulates Ace2, making degradation of Ang II and formation of Ang 1‚Äì7 a possible point of differential control. FGF-23 also suppresses 1,25(OH)2D synthesis, an effect predicted to increase renin production by the kidney. This novel feed-forward endocrine pathway may contribute to the association between elevated FGF-23 and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In addition, Ang II upregulates FGF-23 and Œ±-Klotho expression the heart and macrophages to possible reconstitute FGFR/Œ±-Klotho signaling leading to paracrine effects of FGF-23 to induce cardiac hypertrophy and stimulate inflammation.",/pmc/articles/PMC6098163/figure/Fig6/,PMC6098163,41598_2018_30098_Fig6_HTML.jpg

Examples of clusters illustrate Ras activation and scaffolding proteins, such as IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1). Ras is a small GTPase that is related to numerous cellular functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, fate specification, and differentiation. A key Ras effector pathway is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, i.e. Raf/MAPK kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) pathway. Ras is normally activated in response to the binding of extracellular ligands, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The signal triggered by EGF binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR is transmitted through the transmembrane domain resulting in EGFR dimerization and activation. Signalling proceeds through SHC-transforming protein 1 (SHC), growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and son of sevenless (SOS), the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GEF exchanges GDP by GTP, activating Ras. Active, GTP-loaded Ras dimerizes and binds Raf, thereby promoting Raf dimerization and activation. Active Raf dimer phosphorylates and activates MEK, which induces ERK activation. Ras activates a number of signalling pathways. Ras in the active GTP-bound state regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. PI3K is a heterodimer containing a regulatory (p85) and catalytic (p110) subunits. RTKs recruit the p85 subunit of PI3K. Ras activates p110 independently of p85. PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which recruits phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and phosphorylates a serine/threonine kinase, Akt (also known as PKB, protein kinase B) in the plasma membrane. This further induces the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex, one of the major pathways leading to cell growth. A scaffolding protein, IQGAP1, a large multi-domain protein binds to tens of partners and regulates the function of numerous proteins. Over 90 proteins have been reported to associate with IQGAP1, directly or as part of a larger complex. These include cytoskeleton proteins actin and myosin, as well as other proteins, which are also partners of IQGAP1. Actin is a scaffolding protein too with many partners and also anchors to the membrane such as Ras and Raf. As figure shows, IQGAP1 is a scaffold in the MEK/ERK cascade and binds to many proteins including Raf, calmodulin, and S100 calcium binding protein B (S100). Multivalent membrane-anchored proteins and intracellular multiproteins form gel-like complexes in a network with transient connections.

The lower panel in pale blue color represents the HIF-1Œ± target genes and their acting pathways involved in retinal neuroprotection under hypoxia. Note that five main cellular signaling pathways mediating the effect of neuroprotection are highlighted. Firstly, EPO binds to EPO-R to promote ERK-1/2 signaling, and then activate the Akt pathway, resulting in cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, and angiogenesis. Also, it can maintain mitochondrial membrane potential to prevent mitochondrial alteration. In particular, EPO can be pumped outside the cytoplasm, which leads to the autocrine and paracrine effects that further exert retinal neuroprotection. Secondly, VEGF, which binds to VEGF-R, can achieve the same effects as EPO through activating ERK-1/2 signaling. Simultaneously, it enhances the MEK-1/2 pathway, promoting angiogenesis and inhibiting caspase-3 to constrain cell death. Thirdly, the secreted multifunctional peptide ADM mainly plays roles in vasomotor regulation, and acts together with VEGF to promote angiogenesis. Fourthly, Glut-1 transports glucose to the cytoplasm, allowing normal metabolic activity. Fifthly, HO-1 is degraded by ARE/EpRE elements. While under hypoxia, HO-1 blunts reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the toxic effect on mitochondria. More importantly, HO-1 retards retinal injury through the IRS1/PI3K/Akt2 and Keap1/Nrf2 pathways, which further activate mTOR, upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins, and eliminate ROS.",/pmc/articles/PMC5326762/figure/F2/,PMC5326762,fncel-11-00020-g0002.jpg

(A) Under resting conditions, Nedd4-2 inhibits ENaC and NCC, as does WNK4, ensuring no excess Na+ (and fluid) reabsorption takes place, especially in the kidney. An alternative model suggests that WNK4 activates NCC to a low degree by activating the kinases SPAK and OSR1, which then phosphorylate (P) NCC. WNK4 also inhibits the K+ channel ROMK, to restrain K+ excretion. (B) In Liddle syndrome, PY motif mutations in ENaC prevent Nedd4-2 from properly binding and suppressing ENaC, thus leading to increased ENaC abundance/function and excessive Na+ (and fluid) reabsorption in the kidney, causing hypertension. (C) Removal of Nedd4-2 in lung epithelia by gene knockout in mice leads to cystic fibrosis ‚Äì like lung disease due to excessive abundance/function of ENaC. (D) Aldosterone (or Angiotensin II, AngII?) stimulation of Sgk1 leads to Sgk1-mediated phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 on two sites, thus preventing Nedd4-2 from suppressing NCC and ENaC. This results in increased abundance/function of these Na+ absorbing proteins. In addition, phosphorylation of WNK4 by Sgk1 interferes with the ability of WNK4 to inhibit ENaC. Collectively, this leads to aldosterone-mediated increased in Na+ and fluid reabsorption in the kidney, hence to elevated blood pressure. (E) In PHAII, WNK4 mutants either divert NCC to the recycling pathway instead of lysosomal degradation, and/or enhance phosphorylation (and activation) of SPAK/OSR1 and hence of NCC. Both of these effects, coupled with loss of inhibition of ENaC by WNK4, lead to increased Na+ reabsorption (and paracellular Cl‚àí permeability) in the kidney, and hence to increased fluid absorption and hypertension. Mutant WNK4 also strongly suppresses ROMK, preventing K+ excretion and causing hyperkalemia. (F) Knockout of Nedd4-2 in the distal nephron leads to increased abundance and activation of NCC (and ENaC), causing hypertension and possibly mimicking features of PHAII.",/pmc/articles/PMC3380336/figure/F1/,PMC3380336,fphys-03-00212-g001.jpg

BLM (yellow circle) is one of the first factors to be recruited to the stalled replication fork and this accumulation of BLM is dependent on the NSMCE2 protein (green rectangle) on the SMC5/6 complex (purple ring). The localization of BLM at the stalled fork assists in maintaining functional RAD51 (teal rhombus) exchange during fork reversal. Given enough time in the reversed configuration, the fork is unable to restart (fork collapse). After resumption of DNA synthesis at dormant origins, an active fork converges upon the collapsed fork. The convergence is associated with RAD51 dissociation and a DSB at the collapsed fork, followed by DSB repair by HR via the canonical RAD51-mediated pathway. In NSMCE2-deficient cells (bottom part of model), BLM is no longer recruited to the stalled fork, and there is a failure in the regulation of RAD51 loading at the fork, shown here as a loss of dynamic exchange of RAD51 and RPA resulting in excess, hyper-stable RAD51. After resumption of DNA synthesis at dormant origins, the aberrant RAD51 structure prevents convergence of the active fork with the collapsed fork, resulting in a double fork stall instead of a DSB.

NOD1 and NOD2 recognize bacterial PGNs, iE-DAP, and MDP, respectively. Following ligand sensing the NODs recruit their common adaptor RIP2 by CARD‚ÄìCARD interactions and induce RIP2 to undergo phosphorylation. The members of the TRAF family (TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6), the IAP family (XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2), and the BCL2 family (BID) bind to RIP2 and facilitate its ubiquitination allowing the recruitment of TAK1 and ubiquitinated NEMO to the Nodosome. On one hand, NEMO instigates activation of the canonical NF-Œ∫B pathway by phosphorylating IKKŒ± and IKKŒ≤, by inducing IŒ∫BŒ± phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation, and by freeing p50 and p65 NF-Œ∫B subunits. On the other hand, TAK1 recruits TAB1 and TAB2/3 inducing both (p38, ERK, and JNK) MAPK and NF-Œ∫B activation. Stimulation of both arms culminates in the induction of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs), cytokines, and chemokines. The formation of the Nodosome promotes autophagy and conversely, a fully functional autophagy machinery helps in signal transduction through the Nodosome. ATG16L1 along with ATG5 and ATG12 is required for autophagosome formation, however, independently of its autophagy functions, ATG16L1 negatively regulates NOD/RIP2 signaling.",/pmc/articles/PMC4095565/figure/F2/,PMC4095565,fimmu-05-00327-g002.jpg

Cytosolic Œ≤‚Äìcatenin is continuously degraded in unstimulated cells via a process initiated by its binding to a complex of proteins that includes axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein and glycogen synthase kinase 3Œ≤ (GSK3Œ≤), termed the Œ≤‚Äìcatenin destruction complex. This complex interacts with Œ≤‚Äì catenin to induce its phosphorylation, which targets it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome. Wnt binding by Fzd and a co-receptor, LRP5/6, activates a positive regulator of the pathway, disheveled (Dvl), which in turn inactivates the destruction complex and allows the accumulation of cytoplasmic Œ≤‚Äìcatenin [52]. Stabilized Œ≤‚Äìcatenin can then shuttle into the nucleus and bind to members of the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancing factor (LEF) family of transcription factors to induce expression of target genes [53]. Wnt3A binding to Fzd and LRP5/6 also leads to the activation of RhoA GTPase in a manner that depends, at least in part, upon Dvl and possibly other pathways yet to be defined.

LPS, an important PAMP molecule derived from Gram negative bacteria acting through TLR4 promotes AM necroptosis. However, DAMP molecules released from tissue damage, which is a resultant of severe trauma and HS, significantly influence the regulation of AM death. For example, DAMP molecule HMGB1 acting through cell surface RAGE and MyD88-dependent pathway (as illustrated in Fig. ) ameliorates the TLR4-mediated AM necroptosis. On the other aspect, HMGB1triggers RAGE-dynamin-dependent endocytosis of HMGB1, which promotes AM pyroptosis. HMGB1/TLR4 signaling upregulates NOD2 expression in AM and sensitizes them to subsequent NOD2 ligand MDP to induces autophagy in AM, which negatively regulates lung inflammation through feedback suppression of NOD2-RIP2 signaling and inflammasome activation. DAMP molecule CIRP acts through TLR4-MyD88 signaling to induce mtDNA fragmentation in AM, via a pathway in which NADPH oxidase-derived ROS served as a major mediator for the induction of endonuclease G, which, in turn, directly mediates mtDNA fragmentation. Fragmented mtDNA then triggered AM autophagy and necroptosis through separate signaling pathways, although autophagy also suppressed AM necroptosis, to attenuate propagation of local inflammation. Therefore, AM autophagy represents an intracellular negative regulation of AM death, whereas, pyroptosis serves as a dominant AM death form in a condition combined with infection, trauma and hemorrhage",/pmc/articles/PMC5872399/figure/Fig5/,PMC5872399,12931_2018_756_Fig5_HTML.jpg

The activation of HMGB1 occurs as a result post-translational modifications which involves acetylation of the box B components. This is also associated with the cytoplasmic translocation of the protein. Depending on its redox state, HMGB1 either binds to TLR4 or CXCR4 to promote inflammation or leucocyte migration in the nervous system. The activities of MAPK in HMGB1 signaling facilitate the release of downstream molecules (NF-Œ∫B). Furthermore, it increases the release of transcriptomes (Nurr1 and Pitx3; not investigated), which favors the production of tyrosine hydroxylase (catecholaminergic activity). MAPK also increases the presynaptic releases of glutamate (vesicular glutamate activity) and control catecholaminergic neurotransmission; thus affecting sympathoexcitation. In a separate pathway, HMGB1 promotes the depletion of nNOS and depletes the ‚Äúinhibitory‚Äù GABAergic system; further promoting sympathoexcitation. Change in the expression pattern of IGF-1R may play important roles in the control of inflammation and sympathoexcitation. Through the activation of CamKIIŒ±, IGF-1R reduces the rate at which HMGB1 activates NF-Œ∫B. Similarly, CamKIIŒ± phosphorylates MAPK/Erk1/Erk2 to reduce the progression of inflammation mediated through TLR4. Ultimately, IGF-1R and its secondary messenger molecule (CamKIIŒ±) interact with catecholaminergic receptors at synaptic terminals to exert control on the activation of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors.",/pmc/articles/PMC5590639/figure/F10/,PMC5590639,nihms900444f10.jpg

The activity of CDC42 is inhibited by ARHGDIA, a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor that suppresses intrinsic GTPase activity. CDC42-CDC42EP pathway: Activated CDC42 inhibits CDC42 effector proteins (CDC42EP), which dissociate the complex of septin filaments consolidated by SEPT7 in the spine neck. This opening of the septin barrier permits an influx of molecules from the parent dendrite that facilitate F-actin mediated growth of spines in response to excitatory inputs. CDC42-PAK-LIMK pathway: CDC42 activates p21-activated serine/threonine protein kinases (PAK), which in turn activate LIM domain-containing serine/threonine protein kinases (LIMK). Activation of this cascade inhibits the cofilin family of actin depolymerizing proteins that regulate the turnover of F-actin required for structural stability of spines. Arrows indicate activation and blunted lines indicate inhibition of each target.

Higher levels of ARHGDIA would directly inhibit the activation of CDC42 holding it in an inactive GDP-bound state.

CDC42-PAK-LIMK pathway: The combination of higher levels of ARHGDIA mRNA, lower levels of CDC42 mRNAs and lower levels of PAK mRNAs (Given the much higher expression levels of PAK1 than PAK3, the down-regulation of PAK1 and PAK2 is predicted to have the dominant effect.) would all converge to increase phosphorylation (inactivation) of cofilin family proteins and suppress actin depolymerization, resulting in F-actin destabilization and spine loss.

In the case of the Hh pathway, it is proposed that GPC5 may inhibit the signaling by competing with Patched (the Hh receptor) for Hh binding. Binding Hh with the Patched receptor alters the interaction of Patched with Smoothened, a G protein-coupled receptor, resulting in the activation of Smoothened. This initiates a cascade of events resulting in the Gli entering the nucleus and acting as transcriptional activators. When the Hh signaling is lacking, Gli is bound to a multiprotein complex consisting of Fused (Fu) and the suppressor of Fu (SuFu) and will not enter the nucleus. GPC5 may activate the FGF pathway through unknown mechanisms. Following FGF ligand binding and receptor dimerization, the kinase domains transphosphorylate each other, leading to the docking of adaptor proteins and the activation of four key downstream pathways: RAS‚ÄìRAF‚ÄìMAPK, PI3K‚ÄìAKT, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and phospholipase CŒ≥ (PLCŒ≥).

Both adenoma and cancer can form without first going through hyperplastic and adenomatous, respectively, transformation; the cAMP-signaling pathway leads to hyperplasias1, 2; IGF-II overexpression (and that of other growth factors) is associated with adenomas and cancer; defects of cell cycle genes (TP53, CHEK2) are the hallmark of both sporadic and familial adrenal cancer8, but large benign adenomas can also harbor somatic TP53 mutations9. If the first ‚Äúhit‚Äù is in TP53, such as is the case in LFS, cancer forms without need for any precursor steps; if, on the other hand, the first defect is in a gene of the cAMP-signaling pathway (as in CNC or MAS), the most likely outcome is hyperplasia and adenomas, which only rarely (if ever) progress to cancer. In support of this hypothesis, we and others reported somatic Wnt-signaling pathway abnormalities in adenomas formed in the context of hyperplasias3, 10-12; somatic PRKAR1A mutations also occur in sporadic adenomas that behave like those in CNC.

The Src-homology-3 (SH3) domains in the C-terminus allow the P2Y2R to stimulate Src-dependent transactivation of growth factor receptors and their downstream signaling molecules Shc and Grb2 leading to ERK1/2 and p38 activation of cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth.

Furthermore, P2Y2R activation has been shown to stimulate the PI3K/Akt pathway to inhibit apoptosis in neurons, a response that was dependent on Src activation.

(A) Upon activation through T-cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory signals, T cells engage in growth, and differentiation into different cytotoxic, regulatory T cells (Treg), helper T (Th), and memory T (Tm) subsets cells. Metabolic reprogramming has been shown to intimately support T-cell activation and differentiation. While na√Øve T cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to maintain energy demand; activated T cells engage increased aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis consuming massive amount of glucose and glutamine, enabling to generate effector cytokines, including interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥) and IL-2. In contrast to cytotoxic and effector Th cells, the metabolic profile of Treg and Tm cells rely on OXPHOS and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to support their survival and differentiation. The central energy-monitoring system underlying this metabolic remodeling is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway that boosts glycolytic activity in T cells via activation of transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor-1Œ± (HIF-1Œ±) and Myc pathways. (B) Tumor-specific T cells are often rendered dysfunctional due to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Infiltrating T cells are reprogrammed by the tumor favoring its survival and immune escape. Cancer cells induce several metabolic changes in the microenvironment. Tumor-mediated decreased extracellular nutrients levels cause impaired glycolysis capacity and IFN-Œ≥ production in T cells. Cancer cells also generate a hypoxic microenvironment. Hypoxia stabilizes HIF-1Œ± and enhance glycolysis in tumor cells, a phenomenon recognized as ‚Äúthe Warburg effect.‚Äù HIF-1Œ± also enhances constitutive expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) leading to activation of Akt/mTOR pathway. Activating immune checkpoints and PD-L1 signaling through binding to its receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1) leads to dampening of the Akt-mTOR pathway and reduced T-cell glycolysis. Collectively, tumor environment affects metabolic fitness of infiltrating immune cells and drives impairment of antitumor effector function and increased tumor progression.",/pmc/articles/PMC5346542/figure/F1/,PMC5346542,fimmu-08-00270-g001.jpg

The Yin‚ÄìYang model of Œ±-MSH and AgRP action () suggested competitive binding of these peptides to individual MC4R sites (orange box), and anatomical data suggest in regions where these peptides undergo volume release, that competition for binding to the MC4R may occur. New subcellular anatomical data suggest that in the PVH, AgRP synaptic contacts predominate at cell bodies, while POMC synaptic contacts predominate at distal dendrites. Along with the fact that AgRP immunoreactive fibers are only observed in a subset of MC4R expressing nuclei containing POMC-immunoreactive fibers, Œ±-MSH may this often act independently of AgRP (right circle). At these sites, Œ±-MSH may be expected to signal through both cAMP, and Kir7.1. The ability of AgRP to act independently of Œ±-MSH as a potent hyperpolarizing agonist, via regulation of Kir7.1, suggests the likely existence of independent AgRP sites of action (left circle). Another MC4R signaling pathway, involving cAMP/PKA-dependent activation of KATP channels and Œ±-MSH-induced hyperpolarization, has been demonstrated in MC4R neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the brainstem (bottom right).

They also release transforming growth factor type Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤), which triggers neighbouring cells to release nitric oxide (NO¬∑) and peroxidase (POD). TGF-Œ≤ may affect transformed cells themselves to release these signals too (dashed lines). Through a cascade of biochemical reactions, hydroxyl radicals (¬∑OH) are formed. These induce peroxidative damage to lipids in cell membrane, which then triggers intracellular pathways leading to apoptosis. Panel b: Detailed view of the intercellular signalling cascade, showing the two major pathways identified experimentally, the nitric oxide/peroxynitrite and peroxidase/hypochlorous acid pathways. In the peroxidase pathway, transformed cell-derived O2‚àí¬∑ dismutates into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is by POD converted in part to water and in part, using abundant chlorine anions (Cl‚àí), to hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Upon reaction of HOCl with O2‚àí¬∑, hydroxyl radicals are formed. In the peroxynitrite pathway, O2‚àí¬∑ reacts with NO¬∑ to form peroxynitrite anion (ONOO‚àí), whose conjugate acid (ONOOH) decays into NO2¬∑ and ¬∑OH. Two modes of the peroxynitrite pathway can be distinguished, the autocrine mode with NO¬∑ derived from transformed cells themselves (dashed arrow) and the inter-culture mode with NO¬∑ provided by normal cells (solid arrow). Due to the short lifetime and hence a small diffusion distance of O2‚àí¬∑, all reactions occur predominantly in the vicinity of transformed cells, and the induction of apoptosis is highly selective to the transformed phenotype. Tumour cells produce superoxide too, but in addition also express catalase (not depicted) that abrogates the signalling and makes tumour cells resistant to the intercellular induction of apoptosis.

The HIV-1 replication cycle starts by infection of cells that express A3 proteins (producer cells). In the producer cells, viral infectivity factor (Vif) targets the A3 proteins for proteasomal degradation, but can also counteract the encapsidation of A3s by direct binding without degradation and by reducing the translation of A3 mRNA. If Vif is not expressed or does not bind to A3s, A3s are packaged into HIV-1 virions budding from the cells. During the next round of infection in target cells, encapsidated A3 proteins inhibit HIV-1. Single-stranded viral (‚àí) DNA (generated by viral reverse transcription) serves as a substrate for A3-induced cytidine deamination, which causes G-to-A hypermutations in the viral (+) DNA. Additionally, the presence of A3 proteins inhibits reverse transcription and results in damaged ends in the double-stranded viral DNA. These inhibit integration. A3s also impair the integration of HIV-1 by binding directly to the integrase. The number of integrated, highly mutated proviruses is low. The base excision repair pathway replaces uracils with thymidines: Uracil-containing proviral DNA is first subject to removal of uracils by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) bound to Vpr. The damaged DNA activates the DNA sensors ATR and ATM, triggering the DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR can upregulate expression of ULBP2, a ligand for natural killer cell (NK) receptor NGK2D that sensitizes HIV‚Äëinfected cells to NK cell lysis. In addition, A3s improve the recognition of HIV‚Äëinfected cells by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), as hypermutated proviruses encode mRNAs with missense and nonsense mutations that supply a pool of MHC-I-restricted HIV antigens. Killing of HIV-infected cells may result from a balance between these activating mechanisms and other viral pathways that repress cell recognition by NK cells and CTL.",/pmc/articles/PMC3509687/figure/viruses-04-03132-f001/,PMC3509687,viruses-04-03132-g001.jpg

Upstream of oxidative stress, exposure to NO and/or depletion of glutathione generates ROI, which cause MHP, mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress. In addition to biogenesis, an increase in the number of T-cell mitochondria in SLE has also been attributed to reduced mitophagy. NADPH is generated by the pentose phosphate pathway and is required both to generate NO and to regenerate glutathione. The glutathione precursor NAC is thought to work upstream of oxidative stress by replenishing glutathione and preventing MHP. mTOR is a sensor of MHP but precisely how it is activated by oxidative stress, and thus how NAC prevents its activation, is currently unclear. Downstream of oxidative stress, mTOR activates Rab4A and associated endocytic recycling of CD3Œ∂. These changes alter intracellular signal transduction and T-cell lineage specification, causing contraction of TH1-cell, TREG-cell and CD8+ T-cell subsets, and expansion of TH2-cell, TH17-cell and CD4‚àíCD8‚àí T-cell subsets., Rapamycin prevents the activation of mTOR without affecting oxidative stress.

The transmission of the signalling cascade across the membrane (gray 'bridge' shape) is associated with the activation of upstream kinases. Small G- protein-coupled proteins, such as PAK and RAC, mediate the activation of MAPK kinase kinase (MEKK) or NF-Œ∫B inducing kinase (NIK). The pathway then bifurcates into two branches: the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the IŒ∫B/NF-Œ∫B pathway. One pathway activates IŒ∫B kinase (IKK), thereby leading to IŒ∫B phosphorylation/degradation and subsequently allowing NF-Œ∫B complex to translocate to the nucleus and promote gene expression. The other pathway involves the phosphorylation of MAPK kinase (MKK), which phosphorylates and activates MAPK (p38). This pathway is selectively blocked by the pyridinyl imidazole SB-203580. The activation of the MAPK pathway regulates the downstream activation of MAPK activating kinase (MAPKAP-K2), which phosphorylates the small heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) and activates the stability of transcripts of cytokines bearing the AU-rich element (ARE). The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) provides cysteine that feeds into the biosynthetic machinery, allowing the formation of glutathione (GSH) by the action of the rate-limiting enzyme, Œ≥-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Œ≥-GCS). The activity of Œ≥-GCS is irreversibly blocked by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO). GSH is broken down to cysteine by the action of Œ≥-glutamyl transpeptidase (Œ≥-GT), a membrane-bound enzyme. Redox regulation of the MAPK pathway mediated by NAC is likely to implicate the blockading of the upstream kinase that leads to phosphorylation and activation of p38/(reactivating kinase, RK).",/pmc/articles/PMC150511/figure/F7/,PMC150511,rr190-7.jpg

The topoisomerase-like enzyme SPO-11 catalyzes the cleavage of the double-stranded DNA of one sister chromatid. Both 5‚Ä≤ ends of the DSB are rapidly resected by MRE-11, RAD-50, and COM-1 to reveal 3‚Ä≤ single-stranded tails, on which RAD-51 forms a filament. RAD-54 promotes invasion by one end of the DSB into the DNA duplex of the homolog to form the nascent D-loop structure. As DNA synthesis occurs, the D-loop expands. The D-loop structure is processed by two major pathways to yield COs and NCOs. COs, which hold bivalents together, arise from the formation of stable single-end invasions, followed by second end capture and then the formation of double Holliday junctions, which are cleaved by a currently unknown resolvase. NCOs arise from either processing of double Holliday junctions or the synthesis-dependent strand-annealing pathway, through which the invading end of the DSB is ejected so that it can anneal with its sister chromatid. Following annealing, DNA synthesis and ligation occur to complete the formation of NCOs",/pmc/articles/PMC3764601/figure/F4/,PMC3764601,nihms501791f4.jpg

Annu Rev Pathol. ;10:173-194.",,IRE1Œ± arm of the unfolded protein response,The Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Human Pathology.,"IRE1Œ± arm of the unfolded protein response. IRE1Œ± is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein that becomes activated when misfolded proteins in the ER lumen bind to its luminal domains. The cytoplasmic tail of IRE1Œ± has two enzymatic activities‚Äîa serine/threonine kinase domain and an endoribonuclease (RNase) domain. Upon luminal binding of misfolded proteins, IRE1Œ±‚Äôs kinase becomes activated and trans-autophosphorylates multiple serine/threonine residues on the cytosolic tail. IRE1Œ± phosphorylation leads to allosteric activation of the adjacent RNase. The consequences of IRE1Œ± activation vary depending on the level of ER stress. In response to low levels of ER stress, IRE1Œ±‚Äôs RNase excises a 26-nt intron from the mRNA encoding the XBP1 (X-box protein 1) transcription factor to produce the homeostatic transcription factor XBP1s. XBP1s then translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of many genes that augment ER size and function in an attempt to restore ER homeostasis. However, if ER stress is irremediable, IRE1Œ± becomes hyperactivated and undergoes homo-oligomerization. Under sustained oligomerization, IRE1Œ±‚Äôs RNase endonucleolytically degrades hundreds of ER-localized mRNAs containing an N-terminal signal sequence, which depletes ER cargo and protein-folding components to further worsen ER stress. Moreover, when hyperactivated, IRE1Œ±‚Äôs RNase directly cleaves select microRNAs that normally repress proapoptotic targets. In addition to signaling through RNA substrates, IRE1Œ± oligomerization has been shown to induce activation or upregulation of a number of proinflammatory proteins, including the pro-oxidant protein TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting protein), to activate the inflammasome and its Caspase-1-dependent prodeath pathway. Finally, sustained IRE1Œ± oligomerization serves as an activation platform for ASK1 (apoptosis signal‚Äìregulating kinase) and its downstream target JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase). Phosphorylation by JNK has been reported to both activate proapoptotic BIM and inhibit antiapoptotic BCL-2. Once activated, BH3-only proteins such as BID and BIM disable mitochondrial protecting proteins (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1) and in some cases directly trigger the multidomain proapoptotic BAX and BAK proteins to permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane and release toxic mitochondrial proteins, such as cytochrome c, into the cytoplasm, where they lead to activation of downstream effector caspases (e.g., Caspase-3) and cell demise.

Synaptic connections in the PFC are maintained by normal circuit activity, but are decreased by chronic stress exposure, which also reduces the expression of BDNF. Ketamine can rapidly reverse the effects of stress by causing a burst of glutamate that causes a fast synaptogenic response. This is thought to occur via blockade of tonic firing GABAergic interneurons that express NMDA receptors. Ketamine induction of synapses requires BDNF and activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates the synthesis of new synaptic proteins, including glutamate AMPA receptors. The cycling of AMPA receptors to the membrane is also regulated by GSK-3Œ≤, a target of lithium that has been implicated in the actions of ketamine. Although relatively stable, the new synapses reverse after 7‚Äì10 days, consistent with the time course for relapse of depressed patients after a single dose of ketamine.
